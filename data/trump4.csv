Obama spent a good portion of his presidency on what has been deemed an ""American Apology Tour,""ù where he advocated for a diminished American presence on the international stage.They engaged in a ""lead from behind""ù strategy, which was made very clear in Iraq. The Obama administration announced controversial military pull-out dates in the regions, leaving ISIS forces to gain control of several key regions. Now, these same regions are being inherited by Donald Trump, who has promised to ""bomb the sh*t""ù out of the terrorist organization.On Friday night, the current Afghan Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hamdullah Mohib hosted a dinner at his residence for the wives of American soldiers who gave their lives fighting in his home country. Throughout the evening, Dr. Mohib led a fantastic conversation about his appreciation for the family members of the Americans lost on his soil. He then invited questions from the group.During the Q and A session, the ambassador was asked about the current administration and how Afghanistan views President Trump. Here is his full response to the question:""I've personally met with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the president has had two phone conversations with President Ghani [The president of Afghanistan]. One call was after he won the election and one after [Trump] became president. Before the calls, we were advised to keep conversations short because, we were told, Trump will not be interested in the details of the call and does not have a long attention span, so it would be pointless to have a long call.However, we were pleasantly surprised at how much time President Trump spent asking very informed questions. The first time the presidents spoke, the questions Trump asked impressed us. ""How can you win in this fight [against terrorism]?""ù he asked. ""What do you need to become financially independent?""ù and ""How can American business invest in Afghanistan? How can we develop businesses and mining in your country?""ùTrump would listen intently after each question, often asking follow-ups. Trump's second call with our president was even longer than the first. Asking these types of questions for our country is something the Obama administration never did. The Obama administration was the most academic administration we have ever had to deal with but the Trump administration has been the most thoughtful and intelligent.Trump continually asked ""How can you win? What does Afghanistan need to win?""ù in reference to our fight with terrorism. Trump wants to win. Sincerely. All the Obama administration wanted to do was not lose.The Obama administration was hesitant with us. The enemy could sense that. When the Obama administration announced its plans to pull troops out of the region, they announced the exact date they would do it. All our enemies had to do was wait [Obama] out. They knew the date they had to hang on until ""î which gave them the will to fight. They used that time to recruit and build up resources.To bring real reform, we must be able to defeat enemies outside our country and inside. We must overthrow the Afghan warlords who are profiteering off the war. Every time we tried to remove one of them from power, [Secretary John] Kerry would say ""no""ù because it would potentially make it unstable and require more troops be brought in. The entire Obama administration was too cautious, but Kerry was the most cautious. Perhaps the Obama administration was fatigued by the time we assumed power. [President Ghani assumed power in September of 2014.] But Trump is very different from Obama in this way.This is good, for the future of Afghanistan.""ù",Afghanistan Ambassador Drops Bombshell About Trump And Obama...

He was speeding away from another car crash when he hit Duran's car.Alvarado is now facing charges of murder and gross vehicular manslaughter. He has pled not guilty to every single charge against him.Alvarado has quite the track record. He was first deported from the United States in 1998, after being charged with 20 felonies and misdemeanors, including the possession of a weapon, drug dealing, and trafficking.

Now, reports have surfaced that the Clintons may have been in on the plan as well.The Gateway Pundit reported that the wiretapping could have come about during the tarmac meeting between Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The notorious meeting took place just before the FBI cleared Hillary of any charges in her email scandal, and right around the time Obama allegedly filed a request with FISA.In October of 2016, after his first request was denied, Obama submitted a new request to FISA. This time, it was focused on a computer server in Trump Tower suspected of links to Russian banks. No evidence was found, yet the wiretapping continued. Apparently, the Obama administration deemed it necessary for national security reasons.The report comes shortly after Daily Mail reported that the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee announced that Trump's claims will be investigated by his panel.""We've already begun an inquiry on the intelligence committee into Russia's efforts to undermine confidence in our political system,""ù Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said. ""That inquiry is going to be thorough, and we're going to follow the facts wherever they lead us.

Do you agree?We spend trillions on freeloaders every year, but that looks like it may finally come to an end... or at least start getting under control.President Trump is eliminating waste in the Lifeline program, which includes communications. He's going after the so-called Obamaphones. (via Breitbart)The Lifeline program was actually initiated by Reagan and advanced by both George 43 and Obama.The original concept was to give those in poverty a means by which to communicate. In theory, that sounds okay, but like most things run by career politicians, the program has gotten outrageously out of control.Trump has set new Federal Communications Commission chairman, Ajit Pai, with getting to the bottom of the program and making it more efficient. When people in the system are walking around with $600 iPhones, there is a problem.Why is this program so abused and how did it get so out of control? One word... Obama. His lack of budgeting and control have never been more obvious than they are in this program.A budget actually would have been a good start, but there does not seem to be one in place. That will be Pai's first course of duty to get this under control. During Obama's terms, the number of people dependent on the government skyrocketed. They like it that way. Why cap the support of the government, when such situations keep people voting for Democrats?To be clear, Director Pai isn't looking to put poor people in a worse spot, ""At the end of the day, my focus has been ""î and will continue to be so long as I have the privilege of serving as the Chairman of the FCC ""î doing everything within the FCC's power to close the digital divide.""ù But, that divide does not have to be closed with a high-end phone. A $25 burner will more than do the job for emergency phone calls.When there's less fraud in the system, there's more resources for those who truly need the help. President Trump's more general aim is in line with this. He wants to help those who are dependent on the government to find a way to independence. You see, he sees them not as votes but as people. Human beings.Most people, at least normal ones, do not want to live off the government. But, today, we have more abuse and people that simply have no incentive to do anything but wait for Uncle Obama to deliver them another check. Well, guess what? Uncle Obama doesn't live here anymore!Read more: (Link: www.angrypatriotmovement.com)",Trump Delivers Devastating News To Welfare Leeches Everywhere...

Has he lost his mind?Now is a time when none of us can afford to remain seated or silent. We must all stand up to be counted.History will demand to know which side were you on. This is not a question of politics or party or even policy. This is a question about the very fundamentals of our beautiful experiment in a pluralistic democracy ruled by law.When I see neo-Nazis raise their hands in terrifying solute, in public, in our nation's capital, I shudder in horror. When I see that action mildly rebuked by a boilerplate statement from the President-elect whom these bigots have praised, the anger in me grows. And when I see some in a pliant press turn that mild statement into what they call a denunciation I cannot hold back any longer.Our Declaration of Independence bequeaths us our cherished foundational principle: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.""ùThese truths may be self-evident but they are not self-replicating. Each generation has to renew these vows. This nation was founded as an opposite pole to the capriciousness of an authoritarian monarch. We set up institutions like a free press and an independent court system to protect our fragile rights. We have survived through bloody spasms of a Civil War and a Civil Rights Movement to extend more of these rights to more of our citizens. But the direction of our ship of state has not always been one of progress. We interned Japanese Americans, Red Baited during the McCarthy era, and more. I feel the rip tide of regression once again swelling under my feet. But I intend to remain standing.In normal times of a transition in our presidency between an incoming and outgoing administration of differing political parties, there is a certain amount of fretting on one side and gloating on the other. And the press usually takes a stance that the new administration at least deserves to have a chance to get started ""ñ a honeymoon period. But these are not normal times.

This is about racism, bigotry, intimidation and the specter of corruption.But as I stand I do not despair, because I believe the vast majority of Americans stand with me. To all those in Congress of both political parties, to all those in the press, to religious and civic leaders around the country. your voices must be heard. I hope that the President-elect can learn to rise above this and see the dangers that are brewing. If he does and speaks forcibly, and with action, we should be ready to welcome his voice. But of course I am deeply worried that his selections of advisors and cabinet posts suggests otherwise.To all of you I say, stay vigilant. The great Martin Luther King, Jr. knew that even as a minority, there was strength in numbers in fighting tyranny. Holding hands and marching forward, raising your voice above the din of complacency, can move mountains. And in this case, I believe there is a vast majority who wants to see this nation continue in tolerance and freedom. But it will require speaking. Engage in your civic government. Flood newsrooms or TV networks with your calls if you feel they are slipping into the normalization of extremism. Donate your time and money to causes that will fight to protect our liberties.We are a great nation. We have survived deep challenges in our past. We can and will do so again.

Is Trump a far better leader than Hillary will ever be?1. Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.2. End The Offshoring Act. Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral.4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.7. End Illegal Immigration Act. Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars.9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values.10.

In Pennsylvania, he leads her 43 to 41 percent.The pair remains tied in Ohio.The shift comes after a tumultuous week on the campaign trail for Clinton, who just barely dodged criminal charges from the FBI over her use of a private email server as secretary of state.What do you think of these new numbers?

That controversy escalated this week when Trump told a Virginia television station that he had no regrets about his clash with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq.The feud began when Mr. Khan criticized Trump at the Democratic Convention, a move that Trump says is extraordinarily unfair. The nominee's five-day confrontation with a military family hasn't exactly gone over well.Now, one Marine is speaking up in defense of Trump, writing a letter to the Khan family and offering a perspective that the liberal media refuses to. Read it below and tell us what you think:Dear Mr. Khan,I want to preface this letter by stating that I respect your son's sacrifice for this great nation. By all accounts, he is a true hero that sacrificed himself in service to our country. For that I am thankful.As a veteran, I watched your comments at the Democratic National Convention with a mixture of sadness, and anger. The United States has a military comprised of volunteers. Every single member has made the conscious choice to join the military and serve. There is not a single service member who has been forced into service.It is important for all service members (and apparently, their families) to understand that service to this great nation does not imbue one with special privileges or rights. I found your comments troubling when you said: ""Have you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.""ùDoes it matter whether Mr. Trump has sacrificed ""...nothing and no one?""ù...has Ms. Clinton ""..sacrificed""ù for this nation? How about Mr. Obama? Your comment stating that Mr. Trump ""...has sacrifice no one""ù is alarming. Are you intimating that YOU sacrificed? Sir, your son willingly sacrificed himself. As a father I cannot imagine the pain you must feel but his sacrifice is his own. He was not forced to serve.I am troubled that you would allow a party that has little more than contempt for the US Service Member to parade you into the DNC to denounce Donald Trump. Did you watch when protesters at the DNC booed and heckled Medal of Honor recipient Capt. Florent Groberg? Did you notice your party interrupting the moment of silence for slain police officers? Your own hypocrisy in not denouncing these acts and instead using the DNC as a platform to make a political point is disgraceful. The simple fact is that whether one served or sacrificed does not give greater power to their statements. One vote is as valuable as another. That sir, is why our Country is great. Your condemnation of one person for a statement while standing idly as your party disparages veterans and police officers is the height of hypocrisy.To conflate the need to prevent potential terrorists from entering our country with the belief that 'all Muslims' should be banned is simply wrong and disingenuous. As a reminder, Mr. Trump said: ""ù ""Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,""ù The irony of your son's own death at the hands of these very people in Iraq should not be ignored. I have little doubt that your son would have recognized the need to protect our country from these very people. In fact, he held is own troops back so that he could check on a suspicious car. Your son understood sacrifice and how to protect ""his people""ù...'his soldiers'....'his fellow Americans'...As you continue to make the media circuit and bask in the glow of affection cast upon you by a party that has little regard for your son's own sacrifice, and veterans in general, I would ask you to consider your comments and your position more closely.Respectfully,Chris MarkUS Marine and Navy Veteran",US Marine And Navy Veteran DESTROY Muslim Father Who Attacked Trump,http://americannews.com/us-marine-and-navy-veteran-destroy-muslim-father-who-attacked-trump/t596,2016-08-03 12:08:00+00:00,0.153,"Say what you want about Donald Trump, but he has made one thing very clear: if and when he becomes president, he is going to make sure our heroes are not longer pushed aside.That is a message that has been very well-received by military men and women and their families.In an amazing display of respect and hope, a veteran gave Trump his Purple Heart before a rally in Virginia.

That would include changing America's role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.What do you think of Trump's proposal?àê_",BREAKING: Trump Announces BOMBSHELL Move To Obliterate Entire U.S. Debt,http://americannews.com/breaking-trump-announces-bombshell-move-to-obliterate-entire-u-s-debt/t712,2016-04-05 03:30:15+00:00,-0.075306122,"Over the course of a few weeks, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump's rallies have become hostile events, full of Trump protesters and the most extreme of Trump supporters looking for a fight.In sharp contrast to the story the media is telling, the majority of these fights have been instigated by anti-Trump liberals""îwho walk into the event with guns blazing rather than hearing him out.
