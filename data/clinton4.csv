Now that Donald Trump won by a landslide, they are quickly changing their tune.In fact, liberals are still fighting to get Clinton in the White House. The terrifying part? There's a chance it could happen.Even though Donald Trump dominated the electoral vote 290 to 228, Clinton won the popular vote by 200,000.That may sound like Trump has it in the bag, but the result isn't officially locked down until members of the Electoral College actually get together and cast their ballots on December 19.That gives individual electors the power to go against the electoral state vote. For example, if a liberal leader decides they don't like the fact that their state turned red, they could cast a vote for Hillary or simply abstain from voting. In this case, they would be labeled as ""faithless electors.""ùThere is a slim chance of this happening, but it is not completely unheard of. According to reports, there have been 157 faithless electors since the electoral college was first founded. Of these, 82 changed their vote because of personal preference, 3 dropped their vote entirely and 71 changed their vote because of a death.One important thing to note is that all of these faithless electors have failed to have an impact on the outcome of the election. But Clinton lobbyists are pushing hard; a petition recently popped up on Change.org encouraging electors to throw out a Trump presidency.With the corruption we've seen in this election thus far, this is not a possibility we can entirely discount.

Now, just one week before the electoral vote is official, they've made one last attempt to strip him of the presidency.On Monday, Occupy Democrats reported on a controversial lawsuit being brought forth by Polly Baca and Robert Nemanich in Colorado. The two electors hope to overturn a Colorado law requiring them to back the winner of the state's popular vote. Their hope is that a victory will lead to a revised decision in 28 other states set to cast their electoral votes for Trump.The lawsuit argues that the Electoral College does not currently reflect the will of the people since Clinton ultimately won the popular vote. It completely ignores the fact that this is an important system put in place to ensure all people and all states are heard.""The purpose of the Electoral College, which is made up of electors such as Plaintiffs, is to elect the President and Vice President of the United States,""ù the suit claims. ""There is nothing in the Constitution that permits or requires electors to vote the same as the popular vote in their states.

The effort is a pathetic attempt to get Hillary Clinton in the White House, and many view it as a gross misuse of time and resources.The recount has his Michigan the hardest. Taxpayers are signed up to hand over millions to fulfill Stein's requests, prompting some lawmakers to attempt to pass legislation that would stop this from every happening again. The major challenge is separating revenge attempts like Stein's from legitimate recount efforts that may be needed in the future, the Detroit Free press reports.On Tuesday, a bill passed in the Michigan House Elections Committee made it so that candidates who lose the election by more than 5 percent of the vote would have to pay the entire cost of the recount efforts. As it stands, Michigan law states that candidates who are filing for a recount must only pay $125 per district for the recount.In this case, that means Stein paid around $1 million for the recount, while Michigan taxpayers contributed about $4 million.The current bill will retroactively take effect back to January 1, 2016. If it passes, Stein's $7 million dollar effort could be confiscated by the state. That portion of the measure has received the most hesitances from lawmakers. One thing is certain: the measure would stop people like Stein from taking advantage of the legal system and taxpayers again.The ability to request a recount is an important part of our political system, but Stein's efforts clearly stem from bitterness.What do you think?

The same group concluded their motive was to undermine America's democratic process rather than intentionally help either of the candidates secure the presidency.""Such activity is not new to Moscow""Óthe Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there,""ù the report read, before adding, ""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.""ùNow, sources are telling the mainstream media the hack was intended to place Trump in the White House.The letter to Obama claims there is ""additional information concerning the Russian Government and the U.S. election""ù and urges the President to make the information public.Of course, Vladimir Putin has made it abundantly clear that his administration had nothing to do with the attack.What do you think?

In an interview on Fox News, Conway revealed that she has ""been offered a big position""ù in the Trump administration.On Tuesday, host Sean Hannity asked Conway to comment on Gov. Mitt Romney's involvement in the cabinet and asked whether she would be playing a role in the White House.""Can you comment on both of those things?""ù Hannity asked. ""Because a lot of people think you deserve a big position, like me.""ù""Well, thank you, that's very kind,""ù Conway replied. ""I've been offered a big position. But Sean, the fact is that I'm here to support the President-elect and the vice President-elect, both men whom I know and admire greatly, however they need me right now in the transition. I told them as recently as an hour ago, 'Don't worry about me, all of that will come together.'""ùConway joined the Trump campaign in August, and became the first woman to lead a successful U.S. presidential campaign. Many believe she is a strong candidate for the position of White House press secretary.""But in terms of Governor Romney, I think the secretary of state position is such that, and all the Cabinet positions, you have to be qualified and capable, number one,""ù Conway commented. ""Number two, you have to be loyal to what President-elect Trump has said his vision of the world and his agenda is for the first 100 days or so.""ùHannity then reminded Conway of Romney's past words about Trump during the campaign, when he called Trump a ""huckster.""ù""I mean, remember that speech he gave, it was horrible, just awful,""ù Hannity commented.""Well, I just want to say generally, apart from Governor Romney, that there were a lot of 'NeverTrumpers' who were 'Never Trump' up until the last moment,""ù Conway replied. ""Go read their Twitter feeds. Go pull the tape of what they were saying on TV cameras and in print in different places.""ùShe continued, ""They didn't think he would win and they wanted to pile on. Instead of helping the nominee of their party they piled on. And in terms of a diverse Cabinet, I'm all for diversity but I think maybe one 'NeverTrumper' is enough, so let's not get two, three, five in there. That would be my polite suggestion.""ùConway went on to confirm that there are a number of candidates in line for the position Romney is being considered for. She also discussed redefining the role of Secretary of State after Clinton and Kerry.""You don't need to go fly around the world to be an effective Secretary of State. Kissinger and Schultz, they stuck closer to home serving the president,""ù Conway added. ""That would be my model.""ùWhat do you think?

It's unlikely, but not impossible.At the end of last Wednesday, Donald Trump held 290 electoral votes. He needs to retain 270 to hold his position as the president-elect. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, won the popular vote by approximately 200,000, despite losing the Electoral College (EC).Now, liberals are using this discrepancy to argue that the EC isn't ""fair.""ù They are latching onto a little-known loophole in the EC that still gives Clinton a shot at the presidency: the ""faithless elector.""ùThis rare phenomenon allows electors to vote their consciences in place of their pledges when they deem it necessary.""The office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications,""ù Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 68.The EC is scheduled to cast the final votes for president on December 19th. Hillary fans are getting their hopes up that electors will go rogue and strip Trump of the presidency.An important statistic to note, however, is that 99% of electors throughout our nation's history have voted as pledged.""Since the founding of the Electoral College, there have been 157 faithless electors,""ù one article notes. ""71 of these votes were changed because the original candidate died...Three of the votes were not cast at all...The other 82 electoral votes were changed on the personal initiative of the elector.""ùThe last time an elector voted against his pledge was in 2004, when one elector voted for John Edwards, instead of his running mate, John Kerry. His vote had no effect on the election's outcome.Technically, faithless electors are barred from voting against their pledges in 29 states. The penalties are minimal, however, including fines of up to $1,000.Still, this is not out of the question. If enough electors decide to become ""faithless""ù in this election, Clinton would win the EC and the presidency.What do you think? Does Trump belong in the White House?

It's important to note that the Democratic presidential nominee is not the only one under investigation here; in fact, many members of her inner circle are being looked at.According to Daily Mail, the ""five known investigations are into: Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin's estranged husband, sexting a 15-year-old girl; the handling of classified material by Clinton and her staff; questions over whether the Clinton Foundation was used as a front for influence peddling; whether the Virginia governor broke laws about foreign donations; and whether Hillary's campaign chairman's brother did the same.""ùLet's take a deeper dive into the major players in these cases:1. Huma AbedinAbedin is a top Clinton aide who Hillary has deemed a second daughter. She is involved in two important ways. First, her husband Anthony Weiner is under investigation for allegedly sexting with a 15-year-old girl. This investigation led to the reopening of the investigation last week. The second involves the Clinton Foundation, and whether there is proof of a pay-to-play scandal there. Finally, Abedin could be in trouble for perjury. She claimed under oath that she had turned over all devices that had emails from Clinton's server, but that turned out not to be the case.2. Gov. Terry McAuliffeThe Democratic Governor of Virginia is also involved in two investigations. The first has to do with her service on the board of directors of the Clinton Foundation in 2004. McAuliffe was called into question after 120 donors contributed to both him and the Clinton Foundation, in amounts adding up to $13.4 million. In more recent years, McAuliffe's PAC gave nearly a half-million dollars to the state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, the wife of the FBI Deputy Director overseeing the Clinton campaign. The second investigation involves foreign donations and whether or not they had an influence on U.S. elections.3. Cheryl MillsMills is a known Clinton insider and one of the five that got immunity deals from the Department of Justice, allowing her to opt out of testifying during the investigation. Mills is also a lawyer who advised Bill Clinton during his impeachment and Hillary Clinton during her email scandal. She also served as the director of the Clinton Foundation and as State Department Chief of Staff.Other characters of note include Phillipe Reines, who has been tied to the IT issues at the State Department; John Podesta, Bill's first White House deputy chief of staff and Hillary's campaign chairman; Tony Podesta, who has Russian connections Hillary seems to be threatened by; Doug Band, Bill's former ""body man""ù and Chief Aide; Justin Cooper; staff assistant for Oval Office operations during Bill's presidency, and the one who registered the Clintonemail.com private server domain; and Anthony Weiner, mentioned above.What do you think?

As to be expected, the information included in the documents did not go over well with the American public.Many believe there is significant evidence that Clinton committed serious crimes and attempted to cover them up.Since his controversial decision was first announced, FBI Director James Comey has been defending the Clinton verdict. Recently, he released a statement explaining the reasoning for releasing the documents into the public just before Labor Day.Below is the memo he reportedly sent out to FBI employees, courtesy of CNN:Because it is generating a lot of interest, I thought I should update you on where we are with our commitment to transparency in the wake of the Clinton email investigation. As I promised in July, we have leaned very far forward in providing transparency, on a couple fronts:Congress. In order to afford Congress ample opportunity to discharge its oversight responsibilities, we took the unusual step of sending relevant 302s, our case summary Letter Head Memorandum, and the classified emails we recovered during the investigation to the House and Senate security offices. That permitted them to be reviewed by a number of committees with jurisdiction, instead of requiring that committee staff come to FBI headquarters to review the documents as we would normally require. There have been a variety of complaints because we redacted personal information and, at the request of the originating agency, restricted certain classified portions only to the Intelligence Committees, but our production has been unprecedented. I will be up on Capitol Hill the last week of September to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. This is our regular annual oversight hearing, so I'm hoping to cover many aspects of the Bureau's great work. Of course, I'm guessing folks will want to ask about the email investigation. Through public statements, testimony (4 hours and 40 minutes without stopping, but who's counting), and prompt document productions, we have offered unprecedented transparency of the high-quality work your colleagues did in the case. Now I would like to talk about our other work, of which we have plenty.FOIA. As you might imagine, we have also received many requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and lots of your colleagues have been working very hard to process materials under the statute, get the necessary sign-off from other agencies with interests in the information, and get it out to the public. We finished that process Friday morning with respect to the 302 of Secretary Clinton's interview and our Letter Head Memorandum summarizing the investigation. I almost ordered the material held until Tuesday because I knew we would take all kinds of grief for releasing it before a holiday weekend, but my judgment was that we had promised transparency and it would be game-playing to withhold it from the public just to avoid folks saying stuff about us. We don't play games. So we released it Friday. We are continuing to process more material and will release batches of documents as they are ready, no matter the day of the week.You may be sick of this, but let me leave you with a few words about how I have been describing the email investigation in private to our former employees as I meet them around the country. I explain to them that there are two aspects to this: (1) our judgment about the facts and prosecutive merit; and (2) how we decided to talk about that judgment. I tell them that the difficult decision was actually the second part, not the first. At the end of the day, the case itself was not a cliff-hanger; despite all the chest-beating by people no longer in government, there really wasn't a prosecutable case. The hard part was whether to offer unprecedented transparency about our thinking. I explain to our alumni that I struggled with that part, but decided the best way to protect the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the American people's sense of justice was to announce it in the way we did ""Ò with extraordinary transparency and without any kind of coordination.I explain to our alums that I'm okay if folks have a different view of the investigation (although I struggle to see how they actually could, especially when they didn't do the investigation), or about the wisdom of announcing it as we did (although even with hindsight I think that was the best course), but I have no patience for suggestions that we conducted ourselves as anything but what we are ""Ò honest, competent, and independent. Those suggesting that we are ""political""ù or part of some ""fix""ù either don't know us, or they are full of baloney (and maybe some of both).I will try not to bother you with this any longer.

That controversy escalated this week when Trump told a Virginia television station that he had no regrets about his clash with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq.The feud began when Mr. Khan criticized Trump at the Democratic Convention, a move that Trump says is extraordinarily unfair. The nominee's five-day confrontation with a military family hasn't exactly gone over well.Now, one Marine is speaking up in defense of Trump, writing a letter to the Khan family and offering a perspective that the liberal media refuses to. Read it below and tell us what you think:Dear Mr. Khan,I want to preface this letter by stating that I respect your son's sacrifice for this great nation. By all accounts, he is a true hero that sacrificed himself in service to our country. For that I am thankful.As a veteran, I watched your comments at the Democratic National Convention with a mixture of sadness, and anger. The United States has a military comprised of volunteers. Every single member has made the conscious choice to join the military and serve. There is not a single service member who has been forced into service.It is important for all service members (and apparently, their families) to understand that service to this great nation does not imbue one with special privileges or rights. I found your comments troubling when you said: ""Have you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.""ùDoes it matter whether Mr. Trump has sacrificed ""...nothing and no one?""ù...has Ms. Clinton ""..sacrificed""ù for this nation? How about Mr. Obama? Your comment stating that Mr. Trump ""...has sacrifice no one""ù is alarming. Are you intimating that YOU sacrificed? Sir, your son willingly sacrificed himself. As a father I cannot imagine the pain you must feel but his sacrifice is his own. He was not forced to serve.I am troubled that you would allow a party that has little more than contempt for the US Service Member to parade you into the DNC to denounce Donald Trump. Did you watch when protesters at the DNC booed and heckled Medal of Honor recipient Capt. Florent Groberg? Did you notice your party interrupting the moment of silence for slain police officers? Your own hypocrisy in not denouncing these acts and instead using the DNC as a platform to make a political point is disgraceful. The simple fact is that whether one served or sacrificed does not give greater power to their statements. One vote is as valuable as another. That sir, is why our Country is great. Your condemnation of one person for a statement while standing idly as your party disparages veterans and police officers is the height of hypocrisy.To conflate the need to prevent potential terrorists from entering our country with the belief that 'all Muslims' should be banned is simply wrong and disingenuous. As a reminder, Mr. Trump said: ""ù ""Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,""ù The irony of your son's own death at the hands of these very people in Iraq should not be ignored. I have little doubt that your son would have recognized the need to protect our country from these very people. In fact, he held is own troops back so that he could check on a suspicious car. Your son understood sacrifice and how to protect ""his people""ù...'his soldiers'....'his fellow Americans'...As you continue to make the media circuit and bask in the glow of affection cast upon you by a party that has little regard for your son's own sacrifice, and veterans in general, I would ask you to consider your comments and your position more closely.Respectfully,Chris MarkUS Marine and Navy Veteran",US Marine And Navy Veteran DESTROY Muslim Father Who Attacked Trump,http://americannews.com/us-marine-and-navy-veteran-destroy-muslim-father-who-attacked-trump/560,2016-08-02 19:21:10+00:00,0.078636364,"In a recent interview, Julian Assange sat with ITV to discuss the next release of evidence against Hillary.

We are writing for that purpose.The evidence collected by the FBI during its investigation of Secretary Clinton's use of a personal email system appears to directly contradict several aspects of her sworn testimony.In light of those contradictions, the Department should investigate and determine whether to prosecute Secretary Clinton for violating statutes that prohibit perjury and false statements to Congress, or any other relevant statutes.Thank you for your attention to this important matter.During FBI Director Comey's testimony before Congress, he admitted that statements made by Clinton under oath were ""not true""ù and that her handling of this nation's classified material was ""extremely careless.""ùWhat do you think of this new development?

Hillary Clinton has teamed up with President Obama to blame the attack on guns. Clearly, they are trying to distract from the true issue of radical Islam.The fact is, the shooter didn't target and kill gay people a night club because he had a gun in hand.

For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words 'Radical Islam' she should get out of this race for the Presidency.If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore.
