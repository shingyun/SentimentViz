Unfortunately for them, they were dead wrong. Reports have surfaced that Guccifer 2.0 hacked into the Clinton Foundation database, and found some pretty disturbing evidence.“Many of you have been waiting for this, some even asked me to do it,” he wrote after the hacking. “So, this is the moment. I hacked the Clinton Foundation sever and downloaded hundreds of thousands of docs and donors’ databases.”According to the documents he released, between 2009 and 2011, big banks reportedly offered kickbacks to Democratic politicians through the Clinton Foundation to ensure that Barack Obama’s bailouts got approved. One of these politicians was Hillary Clinton.“DEMOCRATS FUNNELED TARP FUNDS BACK TO THEIR PACS! That’s taxpayer bailout money that went right to the pockets of Democrat PACs!” Guccifer added.This comes just days after a federal appeals court ruled that the US Attorney General could supervise the release of Clinton’s emails. The Daily Caller reported that the ruling overturned the ruling of a lower court that the review of her emails was sufficient. The case was brought forward by Judicial Watch, the conservative organization that has been attempting to get their hands on Clinton’s emails for months.“The department has not explained hwy shaking the tree harder—e.g., by following the statutory mandate to seek action by the attorney general—might not bear more still,” the court’s ruling read. “Absent a showing that the requested enforcement action could not shake loose a few more emails, the case is not moot.”This means that incoming Attorney General Jeff Sessions will have the ability to dive into the case, and potentially reopen the investigation.",2017-01-04 03:33:53+00:00,0.001439037,BREAKING: Clinton Foundation Hacked… But What They Found They Could Never Have Predicted,http://americannews.com/breaking-clinton-foundation-hacked-found-never-predicted/"Last year, investigative author Ed Klein published a controversial tell-all book about Hillary Clinton, outlining some shocking speculations about her health. Now, Klein has come forward with claims that even former President Bill Clinton believed his wife was “in denial about her health problems.”“Bill was so concerned (about her health) that he asked a well-known cardiologist to review Hillary’s medical records,” Klein claimed. “After looking over her cardiograms and X-rays and other records, the cardiologist recommended that Hillary travel with a full-time physicians who would keep her under constant observation.”This doctor was later spotted with Clinton during campaign events, holding what looked like a syringe in his hand, Conservative Tribune reported.Klein notes that Bill was scared to bring these issues up to his wife, because he was afraid of how she would react.“Bill told me that he tiptoed into the dangerous territory of suggesting that maybe Hillary should rethink whether she had the physical stamina to take on the tortures of a presidential campaign,” Klein quoted a Clinton insider as saying.Earlier this month, on his show “Adam and Dr. Drew Show”, Dr. Drew Pinsky expressed his fears about Clinton’s fragile condition.“I still am worried about what her doctors are doing,” he said. “Doctors get turned on by taking care of special people: ‘They’re going to think I’m really good. How extraordinary, Hillary Clinton thinks I’m the best doctor in the land.’ They get turned on by it too much.”Pinsky then expressed concerns that Hillary’s doctors were giving her “reckless” treatment that could be placing her life at risk.What do you think of these claims?

Unfortunately, it looks like Clinton’s hiatus was temporary—she took the time to post to her political supporters on Facebook on the day after Christmas.“I believe it is our responsibility to keep doing our part to build a better, stronger, and fairer future for our country and the world,” Clinton wrote. “I wish you and your family health, happiness, and continued strength for the New Year and the work ahead.

Onward!”Here’s the full post below:According to reports from the Daily Caller, Clinton may be attempting to keep her supporters together for a presidential run in 2020. Sources close to the former Secretary of State say she is confident the American people will want her to step in and “defeat Trump.”“She’s convinced that, soon than later, the voters will come to their senses and realize they made a horrible mistake by putting Trump in the White House,” the source told reporters. “She’s sure the votes will beg her to get in the race…”What do you think?

Now, it appears that their daughter Chelsea is following in their footsteps.Hillary found herself in serious hot water throughout her campaign for her questionable handling of the Clinton Foundation—a “charity” which many suspect is a pay-to-play scheme. Now, Chelsea’s role in the organization is coming to light, and it looks the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. She was apparently using donation money to fund her own interests.Leaked Clinton emails reveal that Chelsea diverted a significant amount of money from the charity to pay for her own extravagant wedding. Those dollars were supposed to be spent on providing healthcare to people in need throughout the world.In a January 2012 email, Bill’s former top aide Doug Band referred to Chelsea’s reckless spending, comments that, “The investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents.”In an email to John Podesta, Band said, “I hope that you will speak to her and end this. Once we go down this road…” The email also commented on Chelsea telling George W.

He’s also the first AG to be held in both civil and criminal contempt.Of course, despite bipartisan votes, Obama claimed executive privilege and did not prosecute Holder.

The DOJ did not respond at all, and the FBI claimed there were “no records responsive” to the request.“This Administration has gone out of its way to hide information from the American public—information that is extremely troubling,” Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel of the ACLJ told reporters.The lawsuit demands the release of any messages that Lynch and her staff exchanged about the “rendezvous” and the names of anyone at DOJ who knew of or communicated about the meeting. The private meeting lasted approximately 40 minutes while FBI security stood on the tarmac and kept the area free from curious eyes—and camera phones.

She is reportedly so arrogant that she believes voters will welcome her with open arms in four years.“She’s convinced that, sooner than later, the voters will come to their sense and realize they made a horrible mistake by putting [Donald] Trump in the White House,” the source said. “She’s sure the voters will beg her to get in the race and she says, ‘I’m going to run again in 2020.’”“She told me—and I’m paraphrasing: ‘Trump has no idea what it’s like to run the biggest corporation in the world, the United States government,” the source added. “He has no f***ing idea how complicated it is, how many cogs are spinning at the same time, how many people are fighting at cross purposes, how much disinformation you get.”The insider also claims Bill Clinton is against his wife’s idea, believing her chances at the White House are officially over.If the rumors are true, this shows just how delusional Hillary Clinton really is.

The meetings are believed to have led to consulting contracts for the group.In 2009, Clinton recommended Deal to Michele Flournoy, who was fresh in her role as the undersecretary for defense policy at the Department of Defense. After the meeting, Deal reportedly thanked Clinton for “all [her] encourage and help with DoD.”“I met with Michele’s other deputy yesterday, and we had a productive discussion about Iran and developments in maritime Asia,” Deal continued. “We also discussed contract vehicles and mapped out what we need to do so that we can go to work!

It dished out about $40,000 more for workshops with DoD officials and think tanks. In total, the group has received about $6 million from federal contracts since 2009.One of the reports delivered to the Pentagon was reportedly entitled “On the Nature of Americans as a Warlike People.”The report claimed that “the United States will continue to use war as an instrument of state policy,” since many in government descended from the Scots-Irish.Flournoy has no recollection of meeting with Deal but told The Washington Free Beacon that she did not directly make decisions with the people she mentored in her position.“Whether any of the people I have met with went on to win contracts with the Office of Net Assessment or other Department of Defense entities was outside my purview as undersecretary of defense for policy,” she argued. “I have and will continue to work with young men and women, including those recommended to me by people whose opinion and judgment I respect, such as Secretary Clinton.”The last email chain between Deal and Clinton took place after Clinton attended Deal’s wedding—just one day before Operation Red Dawn, where U.S. Special Forces killed Obama Bin Laden.“I was delighted to be there and stayed as long as I could at the reception before having to leave,” Clinton told Deal. “I confess that the Bin Laden op the next day consumed most of my mental space!”What do you think of this exchange between Clinton and Deal?

I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and I’m sorry we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.But I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together –- this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America, and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life.I know how disappointed you feel, because I feel it too. And so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful, and it will be for a long time. But I want you to remember this: Our campaign was never about one person or even one election. It was about the country we love — and about building an America that’s hopeful, inclusive, and big-hearted.We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America –- and I always will. And if you do, too, then we must accept this result -– and then look to the future.Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.Our constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power, and we don’t just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things –- the rule of law, the principle that we’re all equal in rights and dignity, and the freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these things too — and we must defend them.And let me add: Our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years, but all the time. So let’s do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear: making our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top; protecting our country and protecting our planet; and breaking down all the barriers that hold anyone back from achieving their dreams.We’ve spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American Dream is big enough for everyone — for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities.Our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will.I am so grateful to stand with all of you.I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. It gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front-lines of our democracy, representing Virginia in the Senate.To Barack and Michelle Obama: Our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude for your graceful, determined leadership, and so do I.To Bill, Chelsea, Marc, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers, and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express.You crisscrossed this country on my behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most –- even four-month old Aidan traveling with his mom.I will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country who poured their hearts into this campaign. For you veterans, this was a campaign after a campaign — for some of you, this was your first campaign ever. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anyone has had.To all the volunteers, community leaders, activists, and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook – even in secret or in private: Thank you.To everyone who sent in contributions as small as $5 and kept us going, thank you.And to all the young people in particular, I want you to hear this. I’ve spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I’ve had successes and I’ve had setbacks -– sometimes really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too.This loss hurts. But please, please never stop believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it. It’s always worth it. And we need you keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.To all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion.I know that we still have not shattered that highest glass ceiling. But some day someone will -– hopefully sooner than we might think right now.And to all the little girls watching right now, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world.Finally, I am grateful to our country for all it has given me.I count my blessings every day that I am an American. And I still believe, as deeply as I ever have, that if we stand together and work together, with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions, and love for this nation -– our best days are still ahead of us.You know I believe we are stronger together and will go forward together. And you should never be sorry that you fought for that.Scripture tells us: “Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap, if we do not lose heart.”My friends, let us have faith in each other. Let us not grow weary. Let us not lose heart. For there are more seasons to come and there is more work to do.I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election.

Now that Donald Trump won by a landslide, they are quickly changing their tune.In fact, liberals are still fighting to get Clinton in the White House. The terrifying part? There’s a chance it could happen.Even though Donald Trump dominated the electoral vote 290 to 228, Clinton won the popular vote by 200,000.That may sound like Trump has it in the bag, but the result isn’t officially locked down until members of the Electoral College actually get together and cast their ballots on December 19.That gives individual electors the power to go against the electoral state vote. For example, if a liberal leader decides they don’t like the fact that their state turned red, they could cast a vote for Hillary or simply abstain from voting. In this case, they would be labeled as “faithless electors.”There is a slim chance of this happening, but it is not completely unheard of. According to reports, there have been 157 faithless electors since the electoral college was first founded. Of these, 82 changed their vote because of personal preference, 3 dropped their vote entirely and 71 changed their vote because of a death.One important thing to note is that all of these faithless electors have failed to have an impact on the outcome of the election. But Clinton lobbyists are pushing hard; a petition recently popped up on Change.org encouraging electors to throw out a Trump presidency.With the corruption we’ve seen in this election thus far, this is not a possibility we can entirely discount.

She may not be our president, but she still needs to be held accountable for her actions.Republicans and Democrats alike are angry with Comey for his handling of the case, and pressure is one for him to explain his actions over the last two weeks. The reopening of the case raised serious questions, and its second closing sparked even more.On Sunday, Senator Al Franken called for Comey to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He was backed up by fellow Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein.“I think there should be hearings, and I’m certain there will be hearings in the Judiciary Committee on this matter,” Franken said on CNN. “We will have hearings.

That has since changed.”“As my colleague, Ed Morrissey points out, President Gerald Ford pardoned President Richard Nixon after he resigned from the Oval Office and before he was ever officially charged with a crime,” she continued. “At the time of the pardon, nearly everyone knew and admitted Nixon was guilty.

Federal investigators are looking into his sexual messaging with an underage girls, and they just happened to stumble across thousands of emails that are potentially pertinent to the FBI investigation of Clinton’s private email server.This was disturbing for many reasons. Americans are not happy that the Clintons have a continued behavior of standing behind those who have committed dangerous sexual or financial acts. That doesn’t align well with Hillary’s message about empowering women.In fact, many of Clinton’s friends have suggested she distance herself from Abedin. Still, she kept Abedin close by her side as she prepared to make a statement about the new revelation to the media.“We of course stand by her,” her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, said on Saturday when he was asked whether Abedin would step down.The question on many Americans’ minds now is whether Clinton’s loyalty to Abedin would inspire her to bring her friend (and her drama) into the White House if she wins the presidency.What do you think?

Philipe in an email to you – which is now being published in many news organizations – referred to me as “malleable.” Of course this is insulting to me as a journalist but I can take insults. However, I don’t think it fair when my interviews have always been respectful and probing and fair. Philipe mistakes respectful and probing and fair for “malleable.” I would very much like to interview you now about this and get this cleared up for my reputation. This would be fair – just as I have been fair. Best, Greta Van Susteren.”Hillary’s spokesman Nick Merrell responded to the letter with the following:“First, let me start by saying that in my many years working for HRC, Ihave rarely heard her or staff more consistently convey respect for ajournalist than for you.

My friend and I were some of the only women in the room. I was feeling nervous. I was a senior in college. I wasn’t sure how well I’d do,” Hillary confessed. “And while we’re waiting for the exam to start, a group of men began to yell things like: ‘You don’t need to be here.’ And ‘There’s plenty else you can do.’ It turned into a real pile on. One of them even said: ‘If you take my spot, I’ll get drafted, and I’ll go to Vietnam, and I’ll die.’ And they weren’t kidding around. It was intense.”“It got very personal,” she continued. “But I couldn’t respond. I couldn’t afford to get distracted because I didn’t want to mess up the test. So I just kept looking down, hoping that the proctor would walk in the room. I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional. But I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions. And that’s a hard path to walk.”Of course, not everyone bought into Hillary’s sob story. Ann Coulter, for example, was happy to tear it apart.“The problem with this corny story that only 20-year-old girls would believe is: Hillary graduated from Wellesley in 1969,” Coulter commented. “Remember? That’s when she gave that speech insulting the first black senator since Reconstruction. So her senior year began in autumn, 1968. She says she was a senior during this harrowing experience, which is when the LSAT is normally taken. But the LBJ administration ended all graduate school deferments on February 16, 1968, except for medical, dental and divinity students, when Hillary was still a junior in college. Perhaps it was that bump on her head that has her confused on dates.

From the beginning, he has thrown his support behind our men and women in uniform.“It is a great honor to have such amazing support from so many distinguished retired military leaders,” Trump commented. “I thank each of them for their service and their confidence in me to serve as commander-in-chief.”“We can only Make America Great Again if we ensure our military remains the finest fighting force in the world, and that’s exactly what I will do as president,” Trump concluded.The letter was reportedly organized by Major General Sidney Shachnow, the only survivor of the Holocaust that went on to become a U.S. General.

Clinton defended the rapist while she was doing legal aid work at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.Audio tapes obtained from a 1980 interview show Clinton explaining how she was able to seize on loopholes in the case and minimize the sentence of the rapist. She also boasted that she was able to negotiate a plea deal that resulted in just one year in county jail and four years probation.“I just want to know, you’ve got a daughter and a grandbaby,” Shelton addressed Clinton, years later. “What happens if that daughter of yours, if that would have been her?”“You would have protected her,” Shelton insisted. “You don’t know me, so I’m a piece of crap to you. Who cares about me, as long as you can win your first case as an attorney?”This revelation is especially damning, given that Clinton claims to be an advocate for children and women. Yet at the time Shelton was attempting to get justice, Clinton went as far as to question her mental stability.We understand that defense attorneys have a duty to protect their client, and sometimes their clients can be pretty disgusting. But that doesn’t give Clinton the right to laugh about letting a child rapist walk free. It’s clear she will say and do anything to win.Watch the full interview below and tell us what you think.

Technically, the FBI makes recommendations to the Justice Department prosecutors, but Attorney General Loretta Lynch has argued that she would accept the bureau’s views in this case.“We cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts,” Comey argued.Trump was not shy about his disappointment in the ruling, arguing that it was “very. very unfair” and “as usual, bad judgment.” He also claimed that “General Patraeus got in trouble for far less.”“Crooked Hillary compromised our national security,” Trump later tweeted. “No charges.

She claims she has been harassed incessantly, to the point that she often fears for her safety.Recently, she took to social media to announce that if she ever dies of “suicide”, nobody should believe those claims.

The first was through a lobbying firm connected to Clinton, and another is through her long-time associate Sidney Blumenthal.Clinton has been linked to Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, through the lobbying firm the Podesta Group, who was co-founded by Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother, Tony Podesta. Sberbank registered with the group just last month lobby on issues related to economic sanctions against Russia.Georgian billionaire and former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili has also been named in the papers, which is believed to be one of the largest leaks of financial documents in history.

The next document was a 31-page memo that detailed some of his findings—including a second gunshot wound on the neck that came from a smaller caliber weapon than the .38 caliber gunshot that was reportedly “self-inflicted.”Because the official report only mentions the wounds to the head, Rodriguez decided to resign from the investigation, claiming that investigators were overlooking evidence.

Later that day, Willey’s husband committed suicide.When Willey attempted to go public, Hillary quickly silenced her. She reportedly designed a “war room” which was meant to crack down on Bill’s victim.“What has she done? What has she accomplished to run for president, to become the President of the United States?” Willey asked reporters. “I can’t find, for the life of me, one thing. And if I could find one thing, I would acknowledge that fact. But I haven’t seen one single accomplishment that would give her the credentials to be president of the United States.”Willey was also asked about the perception that Hillary is a feminist.“Well, that’s a joke, if that’s her one credential for running for president, then why don’t I run?” Willey asked. “There are a lot more women out there way more qualified than she.

She pointed to the reporters that are attempting to “rescue” Hillary Clinton from being interrogated about her health.The response was specific to a Wall Street Journal article called “Republicans Defend Questioning Hillary Clinton’s Health” which was written after Karl Rove asked Clinton seemingly legitimate questions about a brain injury she suffered.To point out discrepancies, Palin reminded her followers the way she was treated by the media.Check out her must-read post below:Hey! Hillary’s brain is off-limits! Leave her health records alone! Democrats are right – scouring records of a female candidate is just politics of personal destruction, and for the media to engage in it would be unfair, unethical, and absolutely UNPRECEDENTED. You can’t probe a woman like that because, well, it’s a war on women!Bunch of sexist, big meanies engaging in something heretofore unheard of, for shame.America, you deserve fair and consistent coverage of relevant issues before deciding a Presidential/Vice Presidential ticket, so have faith the agenda-less media will refuse to push whispers and wildly inaccurate information about a partisan politician’s body part. Goodness, no one credible would print lies, continually harass a candidate’s doctor, disrupt local hospital staff, or even offer to pay locals to give “quotes” about her health records to be included in a “research book” by a public university professor (your tax dollars at work?) which the candidate’s attorney will need to respond to.Thank goodness liberals are consistent in refusing to apply double standards, thanks to their disdain for hypocrisy – so they’ll come through once again! Rest assured these self-designated protectors of what they obviously believe is the “weaker sex” needing protection in the political arena will elevate political discourse. Apparently, Democrats demand their next chosen one’s brain must be absent. Opposition – go there exploring a liberal’s brain and you find nothing; or, find something and you’re just trying to distract voters from the REAL issues.See, the country’s just swell under the Obama regime (which includes any cabinet member who’d lie and prove ineptitude by shining the boot that’s now on America’s neck). With enormous issues to debate before choosing a Presidential/Vice Presidential ticket, have confidence no mean-spirited salaciousness will be pushed by “real journalists.”Nope.

The agreement to compensate M16 agent Christopher Steele for his findings came as intelligence agencies reached a controversial consensus that Russians had interfered in the election by hacking liberals’ email accounts.Trump was quick to assure the public that the dossier was simply “fake news.” After the dossier went public, communications between the FBI and the former spy were ceased—and he was never paid according to plan.Still, the relationship is extremely questionable, especially given that the FBI had previously hired Steele to help a U.S. inquiry in FIFA. Steele had more than two decades working on Russia-related issues for British intelligence. But his dossier was widely unsubstantiated. His claims remain unverified, and they have been strongly disputed by Trump and his team.House Speaker Paul Ryan has confessed that he has seen “no evidence so far” of Trump campaign contacts with Russia. The revelation that the FBI agreed to pay Steele only further damages his credibility.Steele was reportedly frustrated when FBI Director James Comey made a public announcement that they were investing a new batch of Clinton emails just 11 days before the election.In January, Trump was provided a summary of the core allegations of Steele’s dossier—and news of that briefing was soon public knowledge.

Tiffany has been kept hidden from the public for most of her life. After her parents divorced, she moved to California with her mother and remained there through high school. Now that she is gearing up to be one of our country’s first daughters, America is drawing comparisons between her and Malia Obama.There is no doubt that Tiffany’s upbringing has given her a sense of humility that Malia, who grew up in privilege, will never have. While Malia was traveling the world at the expense of American taxpayers, Tiffany was kept sheltered from her father’s elite world. She was essentially treated like a regular kid being raised by a single mother.While Malia spent her later teenager years with a Hollywood internship and using her father’s connections, Tiffany was focusing on her studies. Malia has been spotted out partying at festivals and smoking weed—while Tiffany has been wrapping up her studies at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania.

Though he claims he is staying in Washington only so his daughter Sasha can finish high school, conservative author Ed Klein thinks there is more to the story.“For the past 100 years every president who is outgoing has packed up his stuff, gone home and not criticized his successor,” Klein wrote. “This is not what the Obamas are planning to do. They rented an eight-bedroom mansion in the Kalorama section of Washington from Joe Lockhart, who was Bill Clinton’s last press secretary. In that house, there’s enough room for Valerie Jarrett as well as Michelle and the kids. A place for ten cars to park. They are setting up what they are calling a shadow government.”Klein went on to describe Obama’s shadow government as more of an insurgency operation.“They are staying there because despite what the president said in his press conference, he’s in a sense of outrage over this incoming Trump Administration, which he thinks is going to wipe out his legacy,” he wrote. “So he’s setting up this kind of almost insurgency; he’s picking people in foreign affairs, labor, abortion, union matters. He’s setting them up to start appearing on television, making speeches and doing op-ed pieces.

That’s not surprising, given that Obama has often pushed for a One World government, just like Hillary.At one of Obama’s last meetings with other world leaders in the UN, Obama made this disturbing comment: “We have to put our money where our mouths are. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding—to replace the ravages of war with cooperation—if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions.”“But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action—not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term—enhances our security,” Obama continued. “And I think that’s just not true for us.”This is a terrifying statement and one of many reasons leaders are reconsidering the UN—who’s only intention seems to be bringing about a new world and economic order and implementing an international system of governance. Time and time again, we’ve seen the UN fail to protect those that really need help.

Obama did acknowledge that Democrats and progressive face political challenges, especially in rural areas.“If we can’t find some way to break through what is a complicated history in the south and start winning races there and winning back Southern white voters without betraying our commitment to civil rights and diversity—if we can do those things, then we can win elections,” he said. Obama also warned the American people about an “era where we are looking for simple solutions…that we end up starting to shut ourselves off from different points of view, shutting down debate, becoming more dogmatic, becoming more brittle.”“We don’t have very good population distributing from a democratic perspective,” he continued, throwing in that his party won the popular vote.What do you think of Obama’s comments?",2016-12-27 19:21:52+00:00,0.196066066,Obama: ‘I Could Have Won A Third Term’,http://americannews.com/obama-won-third-term/"Garth Brooks has been in the spotlight during multiple presidential candidacies, from Bush to Trump.

But Obama did not follow that advice when he spoke to Putin about the hacking in September—he simply warned that there would be consequences for Russia if they didn’t stop. The hacking continued.Now, one month later, the U.S. used the “Red Phone” that connects Moscow to Washington to reiterate their warning, this time threatening “armed conflict.” The “Red Phone” system is used to communicate in moments of crisis and is actually an email to link the U.S. and Russia through their Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers.“International law, including the law for armed conflict, applies to actions in cyberspace,” part of the message sent through the Red Phone at the end of October said. “We will hold Russia to those standards.”The Obama administration had never used the cyber line before, and several intelligence officials told NBC that the use of the system had become very serious.“It’s a dramatic step to pick that ‘phone’ up and use it,” Ret.

They claim the stolen emails implicating Hillary Clinton swung the election—a claim that is virtually impossible to prove and largely ignores the fact that Hillary committed crimes.

As it stands, Michigan law states that candidates who are filing for a recount must only pay $125 per district for the recount.In this case, that means Stein paid around $1 million for the recount, while Michigan taxpayers contributed about $4 million.The current bill will retroactively take effect back to January 1, 2016.

It’s no surprise that almost immediately afterward, he jetted off to Europe for his final trip as president.Now, the true purpose of his trip has come to light.According to Conservative 101, Obama’s trip was planned when the White House still believed Hillary Clinton would win. It was designed for Obama to reassure world leaders that the U.S. had ‘regained its footing.’“In some ways, there’s nothing to say,” Heather Conley, a Europe scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told reporters. “Now the president has the unenviable task of telling his counterparts and explaining what Europeans are now coining the ‘Trump effect.’”While speaking in Germany, Trump criticized the President-elect and sympathized with his protesters. When asked about the riots from Clinton supporters, Obama said he “wouldn’t advice [protesters] to be silent.” He added that “elections matter, voting matters, organizing matters and being informed on the issues matter.”“One of the great things about our democracy is it expressed itself in all sorts of ways and that includes people protesting,” Trump commented. “I’ve been the subject of protests during the course of my eight years, and I suspect that there’s not a president in our history that at some point hasn’t been subject to these protests.”What do you think of Trump’s comments?",2016-11-29 03:54:46+00:00,0.055128205,The Real Reason Obama Left The Country Immediately After The Election… Sickening,http://americannews.com/real-reason-obama-left-country-immediately-election-sickening/"Last weekend, Green Party candidate Jill Stein raised a lot of questions when she demanding a recount of votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

And yeah, Hillary’s been a part of that.”When asked what role Palin will be playing in the Trump administration, she gave an interesting answer.“I told Mr. Trump early on that I’m a believer that you don’t need a title, and you don’t need an office to make a difference,” Palin responded. “I’m sincere. I told him that, and maybe he’s taking it absolutely literally, and I’m not offered a post—which, however it goes, is fine with me.

She decided to tell students that they need to prepare for the onslaught of racism that will come their way—citing how difficult it has been for her and the President.“Back when my husband first started campaigning for President, folks had all sorts of questions of me: What kind of First Lady would I be?” Michelle began. “What kinds of issues would I take on? Would I be more like Laura Bush, or Hillary Clinton, or Nancy Reagan? And the truth is, those same questions would have been posed to any candidate’s spouse. That’s just the way the process works. But, as potentially the first African American First Lady, I was also the focus of another set of questions and speculations; conversations sometimes rooted in the fears and misperceptions of others. Was I too loud, or too angry, or too emasculating?

Mitt Romney’s involvement in the cabinet and asked whether she would be playing a role in the White House.“Can you comment on both of those things?” Hannity asked. “Because a lot of people think you deserve a big position, like me.”“Well, thank you, that’s very kind,” Conway replied. “I’ve been offered a big position. But Sean, the fact is that I’m here to support the President-elect and the vice President-elect, both men whom I know and admire greatly, however they need me right now in the transition. I told them as recently as an hour ago, ‘Don’t worry about me, all of that will come together.’”Conway joined the Trump campaign in August, and became the first woman to lead a successful U.S. presidential campaign. Many believe she is a strong candidate for the position of White House press secretary.“But in terms of Governor Romney, I think the secretary of state position is such that, and all the Cabinet positions, you have to be qualified and capable, number one,” Conway commented. “Number two, you have to be loyal to what President-elect Trump has said his vision of the world and his agenda is for the first 100 days or so.”Hannity then reminded Conway of Romney’s past words about Trump during the campaign, when he called Trump a “huckster.”“I mean, remember that speech he gave, it was horrible, just awful,” Hannity commented.“Well, I just want to say generally, apart from Governor Romney, that there were a lot of ‘NeverTrumpers’ who were ‘Never Trump’ up until the last moment,” Conway replied. “Go read their Twitter feeds. Go pull the tape of what they were saying on TV cameras and in print in different places.”She continued, “They didn’t think he would win and they wanted to pile on. Instead of helping the nominee of their party they piled on. And in terms of a diverse Cabinet, I’m all for diversity but I think maybe one ‘NeverTrumper’ is enough, so let’s not get two, three, five in there. That would be my polite suggestion.”Conway went on to confirm that there are a number of candidates in line for the position Romney is being considered for. She also discussed redefining the role of Secretary of State after Clinton and Kerry.“You don’t need to go fly around the world to be an effective Secretary of State.

He also urged the president-elect to reach out to the groups who felt anxious about his campaign rhetoric—and particularly his comments about women and minorities.“I don’t think he is ideological, I think ultimately he is pragmatic in that way,” Obama said. “And that can serve him well as long as he has got good people around him and has a good sense of direction.”Obama also gave a bit of insight into his first meeting with Trump, saying he told the legendary businessman his ability to tap into the enthusiasm of voters was respectable.“I think he is coming to this office with fewer set hard and fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other presidents may be arriving with,” Obama added. “Do I have concerns? Absolutely, of course, I’ve got concerns. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues.”Obama did not comment on Trump’s recent appointment of Stephen Bannon as his White House policy adviser. Bannon has been a leading member of the nationalist movement; a choice that has liberals outraged.“The American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see,” Obama argued. “This office has a way of waking you up. Those aspects of his positions or his predispositions that don’t match up with reality, he will find shaken up pretty quick because reality has a way of asserting itself.”Obama also argued that there are “certain elements of [Trump’s] temperament that will not serve him well.”Perhaps one of the most interesting topics of conversations in the first meeting between Obama and Trump was foreign policy. Obama commented that Trump “expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships.” Obama promised to convey this message to NATO leaders this week.These comments from Obama are surprisingly diplomatic, given that he hoped to transition his role to Hillary Clinton—who promised to continue to push his agenda.

So you can imagine the outrage of Americans everywhere when Trump hinted that he is backing away from this position.According to reports, Trump seemed to waver on his pledge to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Hillary Clinton. At the end of last week, the president-elect was asked about the campaign promise in his first official interview since being elected.“It’s not something I’ve given a lot of thought because I want to solve health care, jobs, border control, tax reform,” Trump responded, clearly dodging the true matter at hand.Supporters are not necessarily happy about his response.

Now, they are banding together to launch one last attempt of overturning the result and getting Hillary Clinton elected.The scariest part? It’s unlikely, but not impossible.At the end of last Wednesday, Donald Trump held 290 electoral votes. He needs to retain 270 to hold his position as the president-elect. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, won the popular vote by approximately 200,000, despite losing the Electoral College (EC).Now, liberals are using this discrepancy to argue that the EC isn’t “fair.” They are latching onto a little-known loophole in the EC that still gives Clinton a shot at the presidency: the “faithless elector.”This rare phenomenon allows electors to vote their consciences in place of their pledges when they deem it necessary.“The office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications,” Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 68.The EC is scheduled to cast the final votes for president on December 19th. Hillary fans are getting their hopes up that electors will go rogue and strip Trump of the presidency.An important statistic to note, however, is that 99% of electors throughout our nation’s history have voted as pledged.“Since the founding of the Electoral College, there have been 157 faithless electors,” one article notes. “71 of these votes were changed because the original candidate died…Three of the votes were not cast at all…The other 82 electoral votes were changed on the personal initiative of the elector.”The last time an elector voted against his pledge was in 2004, when one elector voted for John Edwards, instead of his running mate, John Kerry. His vote had no effect on the election’s outcome.Technically, faithless electors are barred from voting against their pledges in 29 states. The penalties are minimal, however, including fines of up to $1,000.Still, this is not out of the question. If enough electors decide to become “faithless” in this election, Clinton would win the EC and the presidency.What do you think? Does Trump belong in the White House?

Now that Clinton is out of the picture for good, he has expressed an interest in working with Trump.“Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics, and the establishment media,” Sanders began. “People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids—all while the very rich become much richer.”“To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him,” Sanders commented. Of course, he did throw in a last-minute jab, “To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him.”What do you think?

According to Faddis, Clinton’s email scandal is a big deal and one for which she should be held accountable.“I have worked in national security my entire life. Most of that has been in the intelligence community surrounded by classified information,” Faddis wrote. “For 20 years, I worked undercover in the Central Intelligence Agency, recruiting sources, producing intelligence and running operations.

They move in clearly well-defined channels so that never the twain shall meet. Mixing them together is unheard of and major criminal offense. If you end up with classified information in an unclassified channel, you have done something very wrong and very serious.”Faddis then outlined just how dangerous Clinton’s actions were to Americans both at home and abroad.“Every hostile intelligence agency on the planet targets senior American officials for collection,” he argued. “The secretary of state tops the list. Almost anything the secretary of state had to say about her official duties, her schedule, her mood, her plans for the weekend, would be prized information to adversaries.”“It is very difficult, in fact, to think of much of anything that the secretary of state could be saying in an email that we would want hostile forces to know,” he added.Faddis concluded with a very succinct summary of Clinton’s actions, and why she should be held accountable for them.“While serving in one of the most senior positions in the United States Government, Hillary Clinton was at a minimum, grossly negligent in the handling of classified information and when confronted with this practice, acted immediately to destroy information and prevent a full, fair and complete investigation of any damage to national security,” he concluded.”Anyone else who did such things in the government would long ago have been tried, convicted and sent to jail.”What do you think?

It’s important to note that the Democratic presidential nominee is not the only one under investigation here; in fact, many members of her inner circle are being looked at.According to Daily Mail, the “five known investigations are into: Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin’s estranged husband, sexting a 15-year-old girl; the handling of classified material by Clinton and her staff; questions over whether the Clinton Foundation was used as a front for influence peddling; whether the Virginia governor broke laws about foreign donations; and whether Hillary’s campaign chairman’s brother did the same.”Let’s take a deeper dive into the major players in these cases:1. Huma AbedinAbedin is a top Clinton aide who Hillary has deemed a second daughter. She is involved in two important ways. First, her husband Anthony Weiner is under investigation for allegedly sexting with a 15-year-old girl. This investigation led to the reopening of the investigation last week. The second involves the Clinton Foundation, and whether there is proof of a pay-to-play scandal there. Finally, Abedin could be in trouble for perjury. She claimed under oath that she had turned over all devices that had emails from Clinton’s server, but that turned out not to be the case.2. Gov. Terry McAuliffeThe Democratic Governor of Virginia is also involved in two investigations. The first has to do with her service on the board of directors of the Clinton Foundation in 2004. McAuliffe was called into question after 120 donors contributed to both him and the Clinton Foundation, in amounts adding up to $13.4 million. In more recent years, McAuliffe’s PAC gave nearly a half-million dollars to the state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, the wife of the FBI Deputy Director overseeing the Clinton campaign. The second investigation involves foreign donations and whether or not they had an influence on U.S. elections.3. Cheryl MillsMills is a known Clinton insider and one of the five that got immunity deals from the Department of Justice, allowing her to opt out of testifying during the investigation. Mills is also a lawyer who advised Bill Clinton during his impeachment and Hillary Clinton during her email scandal. She also served as the director of the Clinton Foundation and as State Department Chief of Staff.Other characters of note include Phillipe Reines, who has been tied to the IT issues at the State Department; John Podesta, Bill’s first White House deputy chief of staff and Hillary’s campaign chairman; Tony Podesta, who has Russian connections Hillary seems to be threatened by; Doug Band, Bill’s former “body man” and Chief Aide; Justin Cooper; staff assistant for Oval Office operations during Bill’s presidency, and the one who registered the Clintonemail.com private server domain; and Anthony Weiner, mentioned above.What do you think?

Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm.

And the reason … was that Loretta Lynch would not go along with that,” Kallstrom said. “So this investigation was without the ability to serve subpoenas, serve search warrants, and obtain the evidence that they ended up begging for. It was just ludicrous what went on.”He then asserted that the FBI “left so much on the table.” He did, however, defend the agents who investigated Clinton.“This is not the FBI agents who’s to blame for this fiasco going on. This is the leadership. This is Jim Comey … The agents are furious with what’s going on.

And let’s not forget that she has been under federal investigation—an effort that was just reopened because of new information.Seagal has had enough.“I think the most important job as Secretary of State is ensuring our people don’t get killed,” Seagal tweeted. “If you can’t do that…@PeterKostov.”The tweet received immediate backlash, but Seagal refused to back down. He was clearly furious when one Twitter user tried to argue that Hillary was the most “capable” candidate for the presidency.“Capable? Capable of leaving AMERICANS to die. Capable of disregarding law. Capable of disrespecting rape survivors,” Seagal pushed back.He then went on to criticize President Barack Obama for the negative social impact he has had on this country—a legacy that Clinton has promised to push forward.“Obama has been abysmal for race relations in USA. #TRUTH We need to start having honest dialog,” he wrote.What do you think?

Hillary Clinton came in at 44.5%, while Trump ranked 45.2%.The Gateway Pundit also reported that Trump continues to lead with the middle class and those making over $75,000 a year.

He knows he faces an uphill battle in seeking justice for the American people and for Hillary’s crimes. It has become increasingly clear that control of the Department of Justice is held tightly by buddies of Obama of Hillary.It’s unreasonable to think that they are going to police themselves. Think of it: FBI Director James Comey reports to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who was appointed by her close friend Obama. What we’re seeing is a government that is corrupt to its core, and that has been carefully constructed to lean in favor of Democrats.Recently, Gowdy appeared on Fox Business’ Sunday Morning Futures to discuss next steps with respect to his investigation into Hillary Clinton’s crimes and Comey’s role in her getting away with them. Gowdy argued that he got Comey to admit the case deserved “a fresh look after the politics.”“I want to take a fresh look now,” Gowdy asserted.Gowdy was then asked whether he thought Loretta Lynch pressured Comey to conclude that Hillary was innocent.“You know, Maria, the fact that you have to ask that question kind of proves my point,” Gowdy commented. “The next questions need to be directed to Loretta Lynch and her quote, ‘career prosecutors’ about the immunity agreements and what element they thought was missing. No one in the legislative branch can convene a grand jury, indict anyone, prosecute anyone, sentence anyone. All of that is done by the executive branch.”What do you think of Gowdy’s comments.

I don’t think I was the one unsettling him, but I certainly unsettled Rudy Giuliani. When he saw me there he was like, ‘What’s he doing here?’ so I got a big kick out of that.

BleachBit is a program that, like bleach, effectively removes any trace that an email even existed. It covered the traces of her crime network, which also involved shadowy deals made with the Clinton Foundation and is in violation of three different federal laws. Explained Gowdy, “She and her lawyers had those emails deleted. And they didn’t just push the delete button; they had them deleted where even God can’t read them.

The bald agent, who I believe is the shift leader, knows what is going on with Mrs. Clinton and – this oddity is very telling.As Mrs. Clinton jerks back and forth and her legs fold, the bald agent takes her right arm. The staffer also tries to also grab underneath Mrs. Clinton’s armpits to lift Mrs. Clinton.Close examination of Mrs. Clinton’s legs reveal her feet and legs have extended and are not holding her weight at all. The toes of her right foot drag and skid on the pavement. As they lift and push her forward, her legs don’t keep up and she falls forward again.”Byrne went on to claim that Clinton’s movements are indicative of a seizure, and pointed out how all the agents immediately rushes to hide Clinton from view after she collapsed.“When I worked at the White House, a man exhibited the same exact behavior as he froze inside a medical detector. On his full time nurse’s request, I held him under the armpits and stood by him until his seizure passed,” Byrne continued.What do you think about Byrne’s claims?",2016-09-18 12:59:27+00:00,0.026257143,Hillary’s Secret Service Agent Turns On Her… Reveals Sickening Thing She’s Been Covering Up,http://americannews.com/hillarys-secret-service-agent-turns-on-her-reveals-sickening-thing-shes-been-covering-up/"With Donald Trump leading the polls for now, and Hillary Clinton publicly battling with medical issues, the establishment is growing increasingly desperate to take Trump down.Now, it looks like they may be taking drastic measures to make sure Trump does not win the election.According to reports, a Russian television host who is a close personal friend of Vladimir Putin’s just went on live TV to warn the public that Globalists may be planning to assassinate Trump.Watch the video below and tell us what you think.",2016-09-17 03:34:44+00:00,-0.051919192,Trump Just Received Sickening Threat… He’s Calling For Your Support,http://americannews.com/trump-just-received-sickening-threat-hes-calling-for-your-support/"Not too long ago, Ivanka Trump had an interview with Cosmo magazine.

They went on to press why there wasn’t paternity leave for gay men who adopt children.That’s when Ivanka taught them a thing or two about the purpose of maternity, which is to allow the mother to recover after the immediate birth of a child.“In 2004, Donald Trump said that pregnancy is an inconvenient thing for a business,” reporters pressed. “It’s surprising to see this policy from him today. Can you talk a little bit about those comments, and perhaps what has changed?”Ivanka was quick to correct the reporters, who were (as usual) taking the quote out of context.“So I think that you have a lot of negativity in these questions, and I think my father has put forth a very comprehensive and really revolutionary plan to deal with a lot of issues,” Ivanka insisted. “So I don’t know how useful it is to spend too much time with you on this if you’re going to make a comment like that. My father obviously has a track record of decades of employing women at every level of his company, and supporting women, and supporting them in their professional capacity, and enabling them to thrive outside of the office and within. To imply otherwise is an unfair characterization of his track record and his support of professional women. So the policies at our company reflect that, and the diversity of our workforce, from a gender perspective, and in all perspectives, reflects that. So my father has been a great advocate for the women in the workforce, and that’s part of why he recognized that reform is so necessary.”The reporter quickly backtracked and then insisted her questions were “relevant.”We can only hope they grill Chelsea Clinton this way about her corrupt, lying, scandal-prone parents.What do you think?

As to be expected, the information included in the documents did not go over well with the American public.Many believe there is significant evidence that Clinton committed serious crimes and attempted to cover them up.Since his controversial decision was first announced, FBI Director James Comey has been defending the Clinton verdict. Recently, he released a statement explaining the reasoning for releasing the documents into the public just before Labor Day.Below is the memo he reportedly sent out to FBI employees, courtesy of CNN:Because it is generating a lot of interest, I thought I should update you on where we are with our commitment to transparency in the wake of the Clinton email investigation. As I promised in July, we have leaned very far forward in providing transparency, on a couple fronts:Congress. In order to afford Congress ample opportunity to discharge its oversight responsibilities, we took the unusual step of sending relevant 302s, our case summary Letter Head Memorandum, and the classified emails we recovered during the investigation to the House and Senate security offices. That permitted them to be reviewed by a number of committees with jurisdiction, instead of requiring that committee staff come to FBI headquarters to review the documents as we would normally require. There have been a variety of complaints because we redacted personal information and, at the request of the originating agency, restricted certain classified portions only to the Intelligence Committees, but our production has been unprecedented. I will be up on Capitol Hill the last week of September to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. This is our regular annual oversight hearing, so I’m hoping to cover many aspects of the Bureau’s great work. Of course, I’m guessing folks will want to ask about the email investigation. Through public statements, testimony (4 hours and 40 minutes without stopping, but who’s counting), and prompt document productions, we have offered unprecedented transparency of the high-quality work your colleagues did in the case. Now I would like to talk about our other work, of which we have plenty.FOIA. As you might imagine, we have also received many requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and lots of your colleagues have been working very hard to process materials under the statute, get the necessary sign-off from other agencies with interests in the information, and get it out to the public. We finished that process Friday morning with respect to the 302 of Secretary Clinton’s interview and our Letter Head Memorandum summarizing the investigation. I almost ordered the material held until Tuesday because I knew we would take all kinds of grief for releasing it before a holiday weekend, but my judgment was that we had promised transparency and it would be game-playing to withhold it from the public just to avoid folks saying stuff about us. We don’t play games. So we released it Friday. We are continuing to process more material and will release batches of documents as they are ready, no matter the day of the week.You may be sick of this, but let me leave you with a few words about how I have been describing the email investigation in private to our former employees as I meet them around the country. I explain to them that there are two aspects to this: (1) our judgment about the facts and prosecutive merit; and (2) how we decided to talk about that judgment. I tell them that the difficult decision was actually the second part, not the first. At the end of the day, the case itself was not a cliff-hanger; despite all the chest-beating by people no longer in government, there really wasn’t a prosecutable case. The hard part was whether to offer unprecedented transparency about our thinking. I explain to our alumni that I struggled with that part, but decided the best way to protect the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the American people’s sense of justice was to announce it in the way we did – with extraordinary transparency and without any kind of coordination.I explain to our alums that I’m okay if folks have a different view of the investigation (although I struggle to see how they actually could, especially when they didn’t do the investigation), or about the wisdom of announcing it as we did (although even with hindsight I think that was the best course), but I have no patience for suggestions that we conducted ourselves as anything but what we are – honest, competent, and independent. Those suggesting that we are “political” or part of some “fix” either don’t know us, or they are full of baloney (and maybe some of both).I will try not to bother you with this any longer.

Powell said he has no recollection of doing anything like this. After being pushed by the media, he told reporters that Clinton’s team is simply trying to shift blame.Condoleezza Rice plays a role in this story as well.

That controversy escalated this week when Trump told a Virginia television station that he had no regrets about his clash with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq.The feud began when Mr. Khan criticized Trump at the Democratic Convention, a move that Trump says is extraordinarily unfair. The nominee’s five-day confrontation with a military family hasn’t exactly gone over well.Now, one Marine is speaking up in defense of Trump, writing a letter to the Khan family and offering a perspective that the liberal media refuses to. Read it below and tell us what you think:Dear Mr. Khan,I want to preface this letter by stating that I respect your son’s sacrifice for this great nation. By all accounts, he is a true hero that sacrificed himself in service to our country. For that I am thankful.As a veteran, I watched your comments at the Democratic National Convention with a mixture of sadness, and anger. The United States has a military comprised of volunteers. Every single member has made the conscious choice to join the military and serve. There is not a single service member who has been forced into service.It is important for all service members (and apparently, their families) to understand that service to this great nation does not imbue one with special privileges or rights. I found your comments troubling when you said: “Have you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.”Does it matter whether Mr. Trump has sacrificed “…nothing and no one?”…has Ms. Clinton “..sacrificed” for this nation? How about Mr. Obama? Your comment stating that Mr. Trump “…has sacrifice no one” is alarming. Are you intimating that YOU sacrificed? Sir, your son willingly sacrificed himself. As a father I cannot imagine the pain you must feel but his sacrifice is his own. He was not forced to serve.I am troubled that you would allow a party that has little more than contempt for the US Service Member to parade you into the DNC to denounce Donald Trump. Did you watch when protesters at the DNC booed and heckled Medal of Honor recipient Capt. Florent Groberg? Did you notice your party interrupting the moment of silence for slain police officers? Your own hypocrisy in not denouncing these acts and instead using the DNC as a platform to make a political point is disgraceful. The simple fact is that whether one served or sacrificed does not give greater power to their statements. One vote is as valuable as another. That sir, is why our Country is great. Your condemnation of one person for a statement while standing idly as your party disparages veterans and police officers is the height of hypocrisy.To conflate the need to prevent potential terrorists from entering our country with the belief that ‘all Muslims’ should be banned is simply wrong and disingenuous. As a reminder, Mr. Trump said: ” “Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,” The irony of your son’s own death at the hands of these very people in Iraq should not be ignored. I have little doubt that your son would have recognized the need to protect our country from these very people. In fact, he held is own troops back so that he could check on a suspicious car. Your son understood sacrifice and how to protect “his people”…’his soldiers’….’his fellow Americans’…As you continue to make the media circuit and bask in the glow of affection cast upon you by a party that has little regard for your son’s own sacrifice, and veterans in general, I would ask you to consider your comments and your position more closely.Respectfully,Chris MarkUS Marine and Navy Veteran",2016-08-03 12:09:44+00:00,0.130940934,US Marine And Navy Veteran DESTROY Muslim Father Who Attacked Trump,http://americannews.com/us-marine-and-navy-veteran-destroy-muslim-father-who-attacked-trump/"In a recent interview, Julian Assange sat with ITV to discuss the next release of evidence against Hillary.

Elijah Cummings and others from his party on the committee.“They will be shocked when they read the report, if they do bother to read the report,” Gowdy argued. “It is a series of heroic acts by our fellow Americans, and what we can do to prevent the next.”“Yes, Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State at the time,” he continued. “I can’t get around that fact. But the focus of this report is on exactly what the families asked us to focus on, and shame on the Democrats for figuring that out two years late.”“We mention Secretary Clinton’s name less times than the Democrats do, despite the fact our report is twice as long,” Gowdy insisted.Rep. Mike Pompen, who also served on the Benghazi committee, chimed in as well. He argued that it is not just that his Democrat colleagues are ill-informed, but that they actively tried to avoid the work members were charged to do.“We have been obstructed every step along the way…including by the very Democrats today that are calling us political,” Pompen argued. “Go read the transcripts. Look who called the witnesses. Go look who asked the questions. This is not the first congressional inquiry in the history of America. I dare you to go find another congressional inquiry where one party behaved in a way that was deeply obstructive of getting the American people the facts they needed.”Throughout the interview, host Joe Scarborough compared the Benghazi military response to President Jimmy Carter’s failed attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980.Gowdy agreed that tragic decisions were made throughout the crisis, but the biggest indicator of the Obama administration’s true response comes from a meeting held at the White House with Clinton and deputies to top cabinet members, three hours after the attack began.“That was when the decision was made not to go to Benghazi [with military assets], but to go to Tripoli. That is when all the concern was expressed about hurting the Libyans feelings by showing up in uniform,” Gowdy argued.In fact, Gowdy believes that half of the action items that came out of the White House meeting had to do with an anti-Islam internet video, which Clinton and other officials later blamed as the cause of Benghazi.What do you think?

Byrne said that he and his fellow officers tried to conceal from her that she wasn’t the only other woman he was sleeping with, but sometimes they failed. Says Burne: “She pressed the officer about the delay and wanted to know why she was left standing in his security booth. He lashed back. ‘You have to wait. He’s with his other piece of a**.

The article, which was published by one of America’s biggest newspapers, accused Hillary Clinton of being funded by terrorism and repressive regimes.The New York Post piece claims that there have been huge donations to the Clinton Family Foundation by Shariah law governments involved in terrorist activities. It also claims that these groups actively persecute LGBT people.In the wake of the massacre in Orlando, Clinton has tried to position herself as a friend to these communities. She even called out Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait for “funding extremist organizations” and “supporting radical schools and mosques all over the world.”“What she didn’t mention is that all three also fund…her,” the article opens.“The three countries are all guilty as charged. And they’re not just funders of terrorism: All three make homosexual acts punishable by prison or even death,” the article continues. “But the Clintons have taken millions of dollars from those same governments through their family foundation.”“The Saudis have not only given $10 million to $25 million to the foundation, they also donated $10 million to help fund Bill Clinton’s presidential library,” the article notes, pointing out that this “rather tarnishes Clinton’s proud post-Orlando vow to the LGBT community that she ‘will keep fighting for your right to live freely, openly and without fear.’”The article also points out that there remains to be any sign that Hillary has ever tried “to do anything substantive about either problem.

Hillary Clinton has teamed up with President Obama to blame the attack on guns. Clearly, they are trying to distract from the true issue of radical Islam.The fact is, the shooter didn’t target and kill gay people a night club because he had a gun in hand. He did it because the shooter pledged allegiance to ISIS and was under investigation by the FBI. We should also note that Imams in the area have called for gays to be executed. They have claimed this is the “only option.”Donald Trump was quick to take to social media to report what he knew of the story.“Really bad shooting in Orlando,” he tweeted in the early morning. “Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.”Later, Trump was clearly angry and disturbed by the incident.“Horrific incident in FL,” he tweeted in the late morning. “Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?”He then went on to claim that if Obama can’t acknowledge “radical Islamic terrorism” he should resign.Trump also posted this statement on his website:Last night, our nation was attacked by a radical Islamic terrorist. It was the worst terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11, and the second of its kind in 6 months. My deepest sympathy and support goes out to the victims, the wounded, and their families.In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words ‘Radical Islam’. For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words ‘Radical Islam’ she should get out of this race for the Presidency.If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore. Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen – and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can’t afford to be politically correct anymore.The terrorist, Omar Mir Saddique Mateen, is the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan who openly published his support for the Afghanistani Taliban and even tried to run for President of Afghanistan. According to Pew, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.We admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year. Since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States.Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term – and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.We need to protect all Americans, of all backgrounds and all beliefs, from Radical Islamic Terrorism – which has no place in an open and tolerant society. Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans. I am going to be a President for all Americans, and I am going to protect and defend all Americans.

The terrorists win when they convince politicians they should take away our rights, and that is exactly what President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing.”Christopher Hayes of MSNBC noted that Trump’s statement was essentially calling the President treasonous.

Reid claims this would jeopardize the Democrats’ chances of regaining control over the Senate.Matt Viser of The Globe commented that Reid’s focus on Massachusetts indicates that Warren is a preferred choice for running mate.“Reid commissioned a review by Washington election law attorney Marc Elias (who is also the general counsel to the Clinton campaign, and had advised Warren on legal matters in the past),” Viser wrote. “The review only focused on Massachusetts, and Reid did not conduct such a follow-up review on any other state.”Viser also suggested that behind-the-scenes strategic meetings are currently taking place to ensure that Senate Democrats don’t lose another Senate seat to Republicans.What do you think of this new information?",2016-06-07 03:08:09+00:00,0.059232955,BREAKING: Hillary's Likely VP Pick Is Revealed,http://americannews.com/breaking-hillarys-likely-vp-pick-is-revealed-this-is-trumps-worst-nightmare/"For months now, the mainstream media has been claiming that if Donald Trump is the GOP candidate, many Republicans will switch sides and vote for Hillary Clinton.

Oh yeah, did we mention she is facing up to ten years in prison?With consequences like that, it’s no wonder that Clinton has repeatedly lied about her personal email server being hacked by an outside source.In March, Clinton stated that she “did not email any classified material to anyone on my email. There is no classified material. So I’m certainly well aware of the classification requirement and did not send classified material.”Of course, that was later proven to be a lie. At least 1,000 classified documents were found on her server—two dozen of which were ranked “Top Secret” or higher.If Hillary’s email was hacked by a foreign intelligence agency, it puts the United States at great risk. Yet somehow, liberals are finding a way to defend her actions.“There is no evidence that Clinton’s private server was every successfully hacked,” Clinton aide Lanny Davis commented. “All the dire and dark warnings from partisan Republicans about the secretary of state risking the nation’s security by using a private server are, in fact, all speculation—based on no facts whatsoever.”Still, that doesn’t change that fact that it is a felony for a federal official to “knowingly remove classified material without the authority to do so and with the intention of keeping that material at an unauthorized location.” That can lead to one-year in prison.

The organization sought communications between the U.S. Agency for International Development and those affiliated with the Clinton Family Foundation.Jackson was nominated to her current position by President Barack Obama, and reports at the beginning of the year claimed she was under review for a possible Supreme Court nomination.

The request followed allegations that the foundation exerted undue influence on the federal agency, whose sole purpose is to disperse U.S. taxpayer funds for “international development.”The order gives the agency until July 11 to release communications, along with an order to set a schedule for the release of ALL communications after that date.There is no doubt that this will hurt Clinton.

Trump because the fate of this nation depends on sending him, and not Hillary Clinton, to the White House,” Marcus wrote in his piece.“I know Donald Trump, but were not close friends,” he continued. “However, I believe he will begin on Day One undoing the damage done by President Barack Obama. I stand ready to help him at every turn.”Marcus is also focused on making sure that the Supreme Court does not veer to the left.“Like many, I am deeply concerned about the U.S. Supreme court,” he commented. “When Trump recently released his list of potential appointees, I grew confident in his resolve to keep our court balanced. Even more important: Clinton will push the court leftward for generations. She must be stopped.”Marcus also argued that the left’s anti-business policies are damaging our economy, and would only continue to do so.“I genuinely believe that if we started The Home Depot today, we would fail because of the hurdles government, especially the current administration, places in front of small business owners. I never forget The Home Depot’s small business roots—we started as a small business with four stores in Atlanta, Georgia,” he wrote.“I think of the banker who nearly lost his job by taking a risk and giving us a line of credit when we started,” Marcus continued. “He didn’t just look at our balance sheet; he believed in our character and determination. Government regulators don’t allow this under Dodd-Frank—a law Hillary Clinton wants to make far worse. Yet the risks we took in the 1970s have resulted in millions of jobs—not just at the Home Depot, but at our suppliers, our vendors, and even our customers’ businesses. Investors believed in us, and the government did not stop us.”Marcus also directed a very clear message to the anti-Trump elements within the Republican Party.“One of the greatest lessons we took away from the Home Depot is to always listen to your customers,” Marcus concluded. “Without their input, we surely would have failed. Republican leaders must listen to their customers too—their voters—and they have spoken clearly.

The ad targets Hillary Clinton, calling her out for her involvement in the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks.The ad clearly shows Hillary lying about the cause of the attack. Initially, she claimed that some obscure YouTube video was the source of conflict. Shortly thereafter, footage is shown of parents of two of the victims explaining that they were told the same lie from the former Secretary of State.To this day, Hillary swears that she never told families that the YouTube video caused the attack. That’s clearly not the case, especially given that she seemed more than willing at one point to tell the world that it was the cause.The video ends with Hillary bursting into laughter at the Benghazi hearing.

Though Bolton has been a critic of Trump’s, he argued that, “if the country’s not safe, everything else is secondary.”“I believe this is binary choice,” Bolton argued. “The next president will either be Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, unless Hillary gets indicted. Talk about a third-party candidate, I think, is badly misplaced. The idea of not voting at all is no better because, functionally, that’s a vote for Hillary. And it may have a really harmful effect on Senate and House races where Republicans are going to be fighting hard to maintain control.”Bolton argued that if Hillary is elected, we’d be looking at another four years of “Obama’s defeatist foreign policy.”To support his claim, he pointed toward Clinton’s autobiography, “Hard Choices.” In the book, which we don’t expect you to have read, she gave some daunting insight into her vision for foreign policy—and it doesn’t look good for us.“It’s very hard, if not impossible, to find any real difference between what Hillary Clinton writes and what the Obama policy was,” Bolton claimed. “The idea somehow that Hillary would be preferable because she would be an improvement on the Obama foreign policy is badly misguided.”Bolton, who served as Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2008, has until this point held out on endorsing anyone during the fight for the nomination. Though, he did say he would support the Republican nominee.“It’s also important to demonstrate that Trump can fulfill the most important job of the presidency, which is keeping the country safe,” Bolton concluded. “Obviously, the economy’s important. There’s a lot of important issues, but if the country’s not safe, everything else is secondary.What do you think?

But his latest release is sparking outrage.The most recent prisoner to be released from Gitmo and sent to Saudi Arabia was Mashur Abdallah Ahmed al Sabri, a Yemeni national who bears direct responsibility for the death of 17 U.S. sailors in October of 2000. He played a major role in the terrorist attack on the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen.“To those who attacked them, we say: You will not find a safe harbor,” Bill Clinton declared after the attack. “We will find you and justice will prevail.”Apparently, Obama does not support that same notion. Sabri has been released and two other men that are being held for the attack are facing significantly delayed trials.“I just felt, for sure, you know, they’re not going to go ahead and just kiss off the lives of 17 U.S. sailors,” the father of a victim of the attack commented. “In fact, they didn’t do anything.”Sabri is being released despite his label as a high risk terrorist who is “likely to pose a threat to the U.S., its interests, and allies.” He has also been identified as “a member of a Yemeni al-Qaida cell directly involved with the USS Cole attack.”Now, this murderer has been released by our president to return to the world where he came from.

The department claims it can’t reveal the document because doing so could ‘reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.’”Rusty Weiss also pointed out that the phrase “enforcement proceedings” is only used when “an investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law.”This indicates that the Justice department is actually planning to charge Hillary with criminal behavior.

The polls, however, are telling a very different story.Trump’s fans were likely shocked on Thursday, when CBS News (perhaps the most liberal network out there) posted an article entitled, “Yes, Donald Trump can beat Hillary Clinton.”“How would Donald Trump fare in a general election against Hillary Clinton?” the article, written by Will Rahn, began. “The conventional wisdom is that he wouldn’t stand a chance. The GOP is divided. His campaign, despite a recent spate of landslide primary wins, appears to have its own civil war going on. His favorability numbers are at historic lows for a nominee.”Rahn argued that this is, in fact, not the case at all. He claimed that arguments about Trump’s “lack of electability” are “also perhaps overstated.” The Manhattan businessman, he argued, does have a narrow path to the White House—and he may be the GOP’s most electable option at this point.“What happens when Trump, after Hillary inevitably accuses him of sexism, says that Bill is a rapist, a serial assaulter of women, and that she is his enabler?” Rahn continued. “What happens when he incorporates this into his stump speech? The upside, if you can call it that, to Trump’s refusal to act ‘presidential’ is that he is the only candidate who will go that far. Trump, and Trump alone, is the only candidate who would not only resurrect all the Clinton sex scandals, but make them a centerpiece of his campaign.”He also argued that Trump could bring up other baggage of the Clinton’s, including financial.Though his article clearly swayed left, this is the first time we’ve seen the network admit that Trump could have a chance—and it probably has Hillary shaking in her boots.",2016-04-30 03:04:24+00:00,0.065285714,CBS Makes Stunning Announcement About Trump… Nobody Saw This Coming,http://americannews.com/cbs-makes-stunning-announcement-about-trump-nobody-saw-this-coming/"According to recent reports, Bernie Sanders may just have unintentionally handed the presidential election to Donald Trump.In a town hall meeting with MSNBC, Sanders announced that he does not intend to tell his supporters to vote for Hillary if he does not win.“We’re not a movement where I can snap my fingers and say to you or to anybody else what you should do, that you should all listen to me,” Sanders said when asked if he would support Clinton. “You shouldn’t.

Obama does W,Y, and Z, maybe I’ll support him.’ I said I am supporting Sen. Obama.

But rather than proving Hillary right, this video simply confirms that Trump is scaring Islamist terrorists.Dr. Tawfik Hamid, a former radical jihadist and author of a book titled “Inside Jihad: Understanding and Confronting Radical Islam” wrote that the video featuring Trump’s comments about halting Muslim immigration indicates that the group is fearing what will happen if Trump secures the presidency.Hamid went on to argue that jihadists featured Trump in their video not to confirm Hillary’s allegations, but to damage Trump’s strong position as frontrunner and reduce his chances of being elected president. This, he concludes, is due to the common perception that Hillary will merely facilitate President Obama’s weak foreign policies, while Trump will be a more aggressive leader.What do you think about this?

Now, Jill Harth has come forward to say that she would vote from Donald Trump as president.“I saw him recently, and he said I looked good,” Harth told reporters. “I have nothing but good things to say about Donald.”Harth originally filed the lawsuit in 1997, when her then-husband George Houraney was engaged in a legal battle with Trump over a beauty pageant. Trump denied all of the charges against him in the court action, and argued that the matter was tied directly to an attempt to get him to settle in the pageant case.The lawsuit, which asserted that Trump made unwelcome sexual advances and fordicbly attempted to have sex with her in a bedroom at a Mar-A-Lago resort, was dropped shortly after being filed.Now, Harth has acknowledged that the allegations she made in her filing had been made “under duress” and that she’d been “pressured” to file.“The allegations were twisted and embellished,” she told reporters. “Everything could be looked at in a different way.”“Unfortunately, Jill was a pawn in a lawsuit that was created by her ex-husband,” attorney Michael Cohen told reporters. “You will see the case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.

That adds up to a total of 459 votes.In the second vote, however, 232 voters were for Clinton, and 224 were for Sanders. That’s 456 votes. Somehow, between the two counts, 14 people decided to vote for Clinton and three people disappeared entirely.It would appear that Hillary’s team decided to move forward with those numbers, without doing an accurate recount.What do you think?

But guess what. Josh Earnest doesn’t even have the clearance to look into the investigation. This is especially disturbing after seeing he told reporters that Hillary Clinton was not even a target of the investigation.Catherine Herridge said, That statement by Josh Earnest has got the back up of our contacts at the FBI and Justice Department for two reasons… They are SUPER PISSED OFF to use a technical term. Number one, Josh Earnest has absolutely no clearance or visibility in the FBI investigation.

If Sanders was able to pull off those two states, the Clinton campaign would be in severe trouble.Markay explains the situation well in his interview on Fox News. “We’re approaching panic mode for the Clinton campaign right now, because the entire argument for her candidacy so far has been basically her inevitability as a result of her wide name recognition and this tremendous political machine that she has behind her,” Markay said. “So Sanders picks up the first two states. All of a sudden, he looks like a very viable candidate, and I think most rank-and-file Democrats agree with him more on the issues than they do with Hillary Clinton.”Things aren’t looking so great with Hillary.

Essentially, we’re handing funds over to one of the United States’ largest enemies.According to former Clinton advisor Dick Morris, these Iranian funds were frozen during the Carter and Reagan Administrations.

The colors remain on Benjamin Moore’s website.“Capturing the 1798 color requested by St. George Tucker for his home facing Courthouse Green, this deep brown is classic and understated,” the site reads, clearly demonstrating the real origin of the name dates back to Colonial Williamsburg.“Being a black man named Clinton Tucker, the plaintiff found this to be racially offensive,” the suit reads, despite this fact. “In addition, BM has a color called Clinton Brown. A BM employee pointed this out to the plaintiff and thought it was funny.”Now, Tucker also claims that he believes he was denied opportunities to advance within the company because of his race, and is seeking damages for discrimination and a hostile work environment.What do you think?
