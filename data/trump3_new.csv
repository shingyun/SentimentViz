Now, reports have surfaced that the Clintons may have been in on the plan as well.The Gateway Pundit reported that the wiretapping could have come about during the tarmac meeting between Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The notorious meeting took place just before the FBI cleared Hillary of any charges in her email scandal, and right around the time Obama allegedly filed a request with FISA.In October of 2016, after his first request was denied, Obama submitted a new request to FISA. This time, it was focused on a computer server in Trump Tower suspected of links to Russian banks. No evidence was found, yet the wiretapping continued. Apparently, the Obama administration deemed it necessary for national security reasons.The report comes shortly after Daily Mail reported that the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee announced that Trumpês claims will be investigated by his panel.–Weêve already begun an inquiry on the intelligence committee into Russiaês efforts to undermine confidence in our political system,” Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said. –That inquiry is going to be thorough, and weêre going to follow the facts wherever they lead us.

Instead, it asks agents to prioritize migrants who have been charged with crimes but not yet convicted.

Now, in a recent interview with Today, Patriots owner Robert Kraft was asked by Matt Lauer whether his friendship with Trump makes being the owner of the team difficult.–Your relationship with Donald TrumpãI should mentionãgoes back a while,” Lauer commented. –Has your relationship with Donald Trump is any way strained your relationship with some of your players, who by the way, some say they donêt want to go to the White House to celebrate this win?”–Every time weêve had the privilege of going to the White House, a dozen of our players donêt go,” Kraft responded calmly. –This is the first time itês gotten any media attention.”Without raising his voice or losing his cool, Kraft completely shut Lauer down and called out the mainstream media.What do you think of Kraftês response?"2017-02-16 03:50:22+00:00,http://americannews.com/trump-delivers-devastating-news-welfare-leeches-everywhere-party/,0.092687991,Trump Delivers Devastating News To Welfare Leeches EverywhereÄ The Party Is Over,"In a recent editorial piece, Angry Patriot Movement broke down the history of the Lifelines programãand how it has come to be the mess it is today.This is the perfect argument in favor of Trumpês efforts to help those who are dependent on the government find a way to independently support themselves. Do you agree?We spend trillions on freeloaders every year, but that looks like it may finally come to an endÄ or at least start getting under control.President Trump is eliminating waste in the Lifeline program, which includes communications. Heês going after the so-called Obamaphones. (via Breitbart)The Lifeline program was actually initiated by Reagan and advanced by both George 43 and Obama.The original concept was to give those in poverty a means by which to communicate. In theory, that sounds okay, but like most things run by career politicians, the program has gotten outrageously out of control.Trump has set new Federal Communications Commission chairman, Ajit Pai, with getting to the bottom of the program and making it more efficient. When people in the system are walking around with $600 iPhones, there is a problem.Why is this program so abused and how did it get so out of control? One wordÄ Obama. His lack of budgeting and control have never been more obvious than they are in this program.A budget actually would have been a good start, but there does not seem to be one in place. That will be Paiês first course of duty to get this under control. During Obamaês terms, the number of people dependent on the government skyrocketed. They like it that way. Why cap the support of the government, when such situations keep people voting for Democrats?To be clear, Director Pai isnêt looking to put poor people in a worse spot, –At the end of the day, my focus has been ã and will continue to be so long as I have the privilege of serving as the Chairman of the FCC ã doing everything within the FCCês power to close the digital divide.” But, that divide does not have to be closed with a high-end phone. A $25 burner will more than do the job for emergency phone calls.When thereês less fraud in the system, thereês more resources for those who truly need the help. President Trumpês more general aim is in line with this. He wants to help those who are dependent on the government to find a way to independence. You see, he sees them not as votes but as people. Human beings.Most people, at least normal ones, do not want to live off the government. But, today, we have more abuse and people that simply have no incentive to do anything but wait for Uncle Obama to deliver them another check. Well, guess what? Uncle Obama doesnêt live here anymore!Read more: (Link: www.angrypatriotmovement.com)"2017-02-16 03:40:51+00:00,http://americannews.com/breaking-trump-charged-treason-mean-impeachment/,0.134803922,BREAKING: Trump To Be Charged With TreasonÄ This Could Mean Impeachment,"On Tuesday, Democratic Representative Seth Moulton said that if members of the Trump administration have been –conspiring” with Russia as many liberals suspect, –thatês the very definition of treason.”On Monday, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn made the decision to resign from his position after reports surfaced that he had spoken with a top Russian diplomat about the U.S. sanctions against Russia.–I mean, letês not lose perspective on exactly who weêre talking about her,” Moulton said on CNN in an interview with Wolf Blitzer. –Russia is the No. 1 enemy of the United States of America.

That night, there will be a concert that is being called the –Make America Great Again Welcome Celebration” at the Lincoln Memorial.On January 20, Trump will attend a private family church service before getting sworn in.

He just released his official policy position on his campaign website.–The Second Amendment to our Constitution is clear,” the position paper begins. –The right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period.”Trump then goes on to explain that this right pre-exists both the government and the Constitution. In Trumpês eyes, the government didnêt create the right, nor can it take it away. Trump calls the right as –Americaês first freedom,” designed to protect all the other rights we so value.Trump then calls for tougher enforcement of laws that exist today, rather than adding new gun control laws. He cites a successful program in Richmond, Virginia, that sentenced gun criminals to mandatory minimum five-year sentences in federal prison. Trump argues that crime rates will fall dramatically if criminals are taken off the streets for –length periods of time.”Trump proposes strengthening and expanding laws allowing law-abiding gun owners to defends themselves from armed criminals, without fear of repercussion from the government.To address the many incidents of shooters with clear mental issues, Trump proposes fixing the nationês broken mental health system by increasing treatment opportunities for the non-violent mentally ill. He also suggests removing people who pose a danger to themselves and others from the streets.Another point of contention has been gun and magazine bans, which Trump calls –pointless and ineffective.” Instead, his plan focuses on fixing the background check system already in place.Finally, Trump proposes a national right to carry and lifting the prohibition on military members carrying weapons on military bases and in recruiting centers.Trumpês bold and fearless defense of our Second Amendment rights is part of the reason the National Rifle Association endorsed himãand itês good to see he is staying true to his promises.Liberals are outraged, of course, but that is to be expected."2016-11-13 03:47:58+00:00,http://americannews.com/michelle-obama-furious-after-melania-trump-outclasses-her-on-first-day-as-first-lady/,0.130555556,Michelle Obama Furious After Melania Trump Outclasses Her On First Day As First Lady,"Last Thursday, Donald and Melania Trump flew to the White House to meet with Barack and Michelle Obama.

The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.2. End The Offshoring Act. Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.3.

It is revenue neutral.4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act.

Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.7. End Illegal Immigration Act. Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars.9.

That controversy escalated this week when Trump told a Virginia television station that he had no regrets about his clash with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq.The feud began when Mr. Khan criticized Trump at the Democratic Convention, a move that Trump says is extraordinarily unfair. The nomineeês five-day confrontation with a military family hasnêt exactly gone over well.Now, one Marine is speaking up in defense of Trump, writing a letter to the Khan family and offering a perspective that the liberal media refuses to. Read it below and tell us what you think:Dear Mr. Khan,I want to preface this letter by stating that I respect your sonês sacrifice for this great nation. By all accounts, he is a true hero that sacrificed himself in service to our country. For that I am thankful.As a veteran, I watched your comments at the Democratic National Convention with a mixture of sadness, and anger. The United States has a military comprised of volunteers. Every single member has made the conscious choice to join the military and serve. There is not a single service member who has been forced into service.It is important for all service members (and apparently, their families) to understand that service to this great nation does not imbue one with special privileges or rights. I found your comments troubling when you said: –Have you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.”Does it matter whether Mr. Trump has sacrificed –Änothing and no one?”Ähas Ms. Clinton –..sacrificed” for this nation? How about Mr. Obama? Your comment stating that Mr. Trump –Ähas sacrifice no one” is alarming. Are you intimating that YOU sacrificed? Sir, your son willingly sacrificed himself. As a father I cannot imagine the pain you must feel but his sacrifice is his own. He was not forced to serve.I am troubled that you would allow a party that has little more than contempt for the US Service Member to parade you into the DNC to denounce Donald Trump. Did you watch when protesters at the DNC booed and heckled Medal of Honor recipient Capt. Florent Groberg? Did you notice your party interrupting the moment of silence for slain police officers? Your own hypocrisy in not denouncing these acts and instead using the DNC as a platform to make a political point is disgraceful. The simple fact is that whether one served or sacrificed does not give greater power to their statements. One vote is as valuable as another. That sir, is why our Country is great. Your condemnation of one person for a statement while standing idly as your party disparages veterans and police officers is the height of hypocrisy.To conflate the need to prevent potential terrorists from entering our country with the belief that •all Muslimsê should be banned is simply wrong and disingenuous. As a reminder, Mr. Trump said: ” –Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,” The irony of your sonês own death at the hands of these very people in Iraq should not be ignored. I have little doubt that your son would have recognized the need to protect our country from these very people. In fact, he held is own troops back so that he could check on a suspicious car. Your son understood sacrifice and how to protect –his people”Äêhis soldiersêÄ.êhis fellow AmericansêÄAs you continue to make the media circuit and bask in the glow of affection cast upon you by a party that has little regard for your sonês own sacrifice, and veterans in general, I would ask you to consider your comments and your position more closely.Respectfully,Chris MarkUS Marine and Navy Veteran"2016-08-03 12:08:00+00:00,http://americannews.com/vet-gives-trump-his-purple-heart-but-what-happened-next-gives-me-goosebumps-video/,0.153,Vet Gives Trump His Purple HeartÄ But What Happened Next Gives Me Goosebumps [VIDEO],"Say what you want about Donald Trump, but he has made one thing very clear: if and when he becomes president, he is going to make sure our heroes are not longer pushed aside.That is a message that has been very well-received by military men and women and their families.In an amazing display of respect and hope, a veteran gave Trump his Purple Heart before a rally in Virginia.

Hillary Clinton has teamed up with President Obama to blame the attack on guns. Clearly, they are trying to distract from the true issue of radical Islam.The fact is, the shooter didnêt target and kill gay people a night club because he had a gun in hand. He did it because the shooter pledged allegiance to ISIS and was under investigation by the FBI. We should also note that Imams in the area have called for gays to be executed. They have claimed this is the –only option.”Donald Trump was quick to take to social media to report what he knew of the story.–Really bad shooting in Orlando,” he tweeted in the early morning. –Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.”Later, Trump was clearly angry and disturbed by the incident.–Horrific incident in FL,” he tweeted in the late morning. –Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?”He then went on to claim that if Obama canêt acknowledge –radical Islamic terrorism” he should resign.Trump also posted this statement on his website:Last night, our nation was attacked by a radical Islamic terrorist. It was the worst terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11, and the second of its kind in 6 months. My deepest sympathy and support goes out to the victims, the wounded, and their families.In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words •Radical Islamê. For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words •Radical Islamê she should get out of this race for the Presidency.If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore. Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen _ and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We canêt afford to be politically correct anymore.The terrorist, Omar Mir Saddique Mateen, is the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan who openly published his support for the Afghanistani Taliban and even tried to run for President of Afghanistan. According to Pew, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.We admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year. Since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States.Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term _ and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.We need to protect all Americans, of all backgrounds and all beliefs, from Radical Islamic Terrorism _ which has no place in an open and tolerant society. Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans. I am going to be a President for all Americans, and I am going to protect and defend all Americans. We are going to make America safe again and great again for everyone._ Donald J.
