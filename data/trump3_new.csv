But of course I am deeply worried that his selections of advisors and cabinet posts suggests otherwise.To all of you I say, stay vigilant. The great Martin Luther King, Jr. knew that even as a minority, there was strength in numbers in fighting tyranny. Holding hands and marching forward, raising your voice above the din of complacency, can move mountains.

Read the post below and tell us what you think:In America, all people have the same rights. Women donÕt make less than men when doing the same job. The wage gap has been thoroughly debunked Ñ unless you listen to Rachel Maddow explain why her multi-million dollar salary isnÕt enough. Lady GagaÕs fear for her life belongs solely to her, and not to the rest of the American women who take responsibility for our own lives. So, speak for yourself, Lady Gaga.The United States affords women the opportunity to defend their lives with guns. If the scared left is so worried about their lives, maybe they should buck up and defend themselves instead of simply buying more Kleenex. In America, all citizens are given the right to self-defense, a natural right that is denied to most other inhabitants of the globe.Normal and rational women arenÕt fearing for their lives because we understand that we can defend ourselves against aggression, thanks to the right to bear arms Ñ and yes, that includes aggressions from the government that liberals worship and wish had more power.ItÕs about time we empower women, instead of terrifying them with liberal rhetoric. ItÕs amazing that these liberals still donÕt get it. The complaining and whining will take them only so far. At some point, the realization that not everyone should get a participation trophy will damage so many liberals minds that we may see an even greater meltdown of the American liberal.In the meantime, IÕd advise Lady Gaga not to put all women in this Òscared leftistÓ box.

ÒThe right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period.ÓTrump then goes on to explain that this right pre-exists both the government and the Constitution. In TrumpÕs eyes, the government didnÕt create the right, nor can it take it away. Trump calls the right as ÒAmericaÕs first freedom,Ó designed to protect all the other rights we so value.Trump then calls for tougher enforcement of laws that exist today, rather than adding new gun control laws. He cites a successful program in Richmond, Virginia, that sentenced gun criminals to mandatory minimum five-year sentences in federal prison. Trump argues that crime rates will fall dramatically if criminals are taken off the streets for Òlength periods of time.ÓTrump proposes strengthening and expanding laws allowing law-abiding gun owners to defends themselves from armed criminals, without fear of repercussion from the government.To address the many incidents of shooters with clear mental issues, Trump proposes fixing the nationÕs broken mental health system by increasing treatment opportunities for the non-violent mentally ill. He also suggests removing people who pose a danger to themselves and others from the streets.Another point of contention has been gun and magazine bans, which Trump calls Òpointless and ineffective.Ó Instead, his plan focuses on fixing the background check system already in place.Finally, Trump proposes a national right to carry and lifting the prohibition on military members carrying weapons on military bases and in recruiting centers.TrumpÕs bold and fearless defense of our Second Amendment rights is part of the reason the National Rifle Association endorsed himÑand itÕs good to see he is staying true to his promises.Liberals are outraged, of course, but that is to be expected."2016-11-13 03:47:58+00:00,http://americannews.com/michelle-obama-furious-after-melania-trump-outclasses-her-on-first-day-as-first-lady/,0.130555556,Michelle Obama Furious After Melania Trump Outclasses Her On First Day As First Lady,"Last Thursday, Donald and Melania Trump flew to the White House to meet with Barack and Michelle Obama.

ÒIn the first visit to the White House after the 2008 election, Mr. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama posed for the cameras alongside President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush.

An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate.2. End The Offshoring Act. Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free.3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral.4. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications.6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families.7. End Illegal Immigration Act. Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars.9. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values.10.

I realize Mr. Trump doesnÕt know me personally, but for those that do, know that I am the first one to excuse myself and my child when he begins to cry because I personally believe itÕs rude to disturb anyone elseÕs ability to hear what they came to see. IÕve left movies, violin recitals, and other events if I felt my child was disturbing others. It is the considerate thing to do. I stood right outside the doors of the auditorium continuing to watch and listen to what Mr. Trump had to say. In fact, the police that were right outside in the same hallway with me, treated me with so much respect it was incredible. They were so kind and made me feel welcomed to stand with them. One officer commended me on my bravery to bring my child to Mr. TrumpÕs rally. I fully support Mr. Trump. I thought he responded very graciously to my child crying and he made a lighthearted moment out of what I usually consider to be stressful. I actually was out of the auditorium before he even made his follow up comment about my child and even then, when I was informed of his comment, I laughed. I understand he says things jokingly, and I understand no one wants to speak over or struggle to listen over a crying baby.I am in no way offended and I again reiterate, Mr. Trump NEVER kicked me or my child out of the Briar Woods High School, Trump rally. And for the record, while my child and I stood outside of the auditorium, my eleven year old stepdaughter and my Grandmother sat inside the auditorium and continued to support and listen to everything Mr. Trump had to say. We all were so excited to be able to see Mr. Trump so close to home. I didnÕt have a babysitter to watch my kids and honestly, to me it was a historical moment that I am happy that my kids were there for. I apologize for the trouble this has caused Mr. Trump. The media has severely blown this out of proportion and made it out to be something that it wasnÕt and is clearly using this as political gain for the Democratic party.

That controversy escalated this week when Trump told a Virginia television station that he had no regrets about his clash with Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of an Army captain killed in Iraq.The feud began when Mr. Khan criticized Trump at the Democratic Convention, a move that Trump says is extraordinarily unfair. The nomineeÕs five-day confrontation with a military family hasnÕt exactly gone over well.Now, one Marine is speaking up in defense of Trump, writing a letter to the Khan family and offering a perspective that the liberal media refuses to. Read it below and tell us what you think:Dear Mr. Khan,I want to preface this letter by stating that I respect your sonÕs sacrifice for this great nation. By all accounts, he is a true hero that sacrificed himself in service to our country. For that I am thankful.As a veteran, I watched your comments at the Democratic National Convention with a mixture of sadness, and anger. The United States has a military comprised of volunteers. Every single member has made the conscious choice to join the military and serve. There is not a single service member who has been forced into service.It is important for all service members (and apparently, their families) to understand that service to this great nation does not imbue one with special privileges or rights. I found your comments troubling when you said: ÒHave you ever been to Arlington cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one.ÓDoes it matter whether Mr. Trump has sacrificed ÒÉnothing and no one?ÓÉhas Ms. Clinton Ò..sacrificedÓ for this nation? How about Mr. Obama? Your comment stating that Mr. Trump ÒÉhas sacrifice no oneÓ is alarming. Are you intimating that YOU sacrificed? Sir, your son willingly sacrificed himself. As a father I cannot imagine the pain you must feel but his sacrifice is his own. He was not forced to serve.I am troubled that you would allow a party that has little more than contempt for the US Service Member to parade you into the DNC to denounce Donald Trump. Did you watch when protesters at the DNC booed and heckled Medal of Honor recipient Capt. Florent Groberg? Did you notice your party interrupting the moment of silence for slain police officers? Your own hypocrisy in not denouncing these acts and instead using the DNC as a platform to make a political point is disgraceful. The simple fact is that whether one served or sacrificed does not give greater power to their statements. One vote is as valuable as another. That sir, is why our Country is great. Your condemnation of one person for a statement while standing idly as your party disparages veterans and police officers is the height of hypocrisy.To conflate the need to prevent potential terrorists from entering our country with the belief that Ôall MuslimsÕ should be banned is simply wrong and disingenuous. As a reminder, Mr. Trump said: Ó ÒUntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,Ó The irony of your sonÕs own death at the hands of these very people in Iraq should not be ignored. I have little doubt that your son would have recognized the need to protect our country from these very people. In fact, he held is own troops back so that he could check on a suspicious car. Your son understood sacrifice and how to protect Òhis peopleÓÉÕhis soldiersÕÉ.Õhis fellow AmericansÕÉAs you continue to make the media circuit and bask in the glow of affection cast upon you by a party that has little regard for your sonÕs own sacrifice, and veterans in general, I would ask you to consider your comments and your position more closely.Respectfully,Chris MarkUS Marine and Navy Veteran"2016-08-03 12:08:00+00:00,http://americannews.com/vet-gives-trump-his-purple-heart-but-what-happened-next-gives-me-goosebumps-video/,0.153,Vet Gives Trump His Purple HeartÉ But What Happened Next Gives Me Goosebumps [VIDEO],"Say what you want about Donald Trump, but he has made one thing very clear: if and when he becomes president, he is going to make sure our heroes are not longer pushed aside.That is a message that has been very well-received by military men and women and their families.In an amazing display of respect and hope, a veteran gave Trump his Purple Heart before a rally in Virginia.

Hillary Clinton has teamed up with President Obama to blame the attack on guns. Clearly, they are trying to distract from the true issue of radical Islam.The fact is, the shooter didnÕt target and kill gay people a night club because he had a gun in hand. He did it because the shooter pledged allegiance to ISIS and was under investigation by the FBI. We should also note that Imams in the area have called for gays to be executed. They have claimed this is the Òonly option.ÓDonald Trump was quick to take to social media to report what he knew of the story.ÒReally bad shooting in Orlando,Ó he tweeted in the early morning. ÒPolice investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.ÓLater, Trump was clearly angry and disturbed by the incident.ÒHorrific incident in FL,Ó he tweeted in the late morning. ÒPraying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?ÓHe then went on to claim that if Obama canÕt acknowledge Òradical Islamic terrorismÓ he should resign.Trump also posted this statement on his website:Last night, our nation was attacked by a radical Islamic terrorist. It was the worst terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11, and the second of its kind in 6 months. My deepest sympathy and support goes out to the victims, the wounded, and their families.In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words ÔRadical IslamÕ. For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words ÔRadical IslamÕ she should get out of this race for the Presidency.If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore. Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen _ and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We canÕt afford to be politically correct anymore.The terrorist, Omar Mir Saddique Mateen, is the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan who openly published his support for the Afghanistani Taliban and even tried to run for President of Afghanistan. According to Pew, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.We admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year. Since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States.Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term _ and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.We need to protect all Americans, of all backgrounds and all beliefs, from Radical Islamic Terrorism _ which has no place in an open and tolerant society. Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans. I am going to be a President for all Americans, and I am going to protect and defend all Americans. We are going to make America safe again and great again for everyone._ Donald J.

The first option is that Obama was born in America and went to college as an AmericaÑwhich trump highly doubts. The second is that he was born in Kenya and his eligibility as president is null and void.
